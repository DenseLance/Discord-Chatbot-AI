"@doyle0213 @MissAshes92 The reduced price is a benefit of membership, like reduced conference fees and concference discounts are. Members pay less for things the organization charges money for."
"@MissAshes92 @doyle0213 It would be cool if someone came up with something free and sustainable. Others have tried, but ultimately found it couldn't be done on goodwill alone."
@MissAshes92 @doyle0213 Maybe you can work with AEMO or something to come up with an alternative.
"@MissAshes92 @doyle0213 A lot of them don't require a degree to be certified for instance. Or they require different, or fewer, professional contributions. Or maybe no essay. Some are based solely on training, not on professional activities and experience."
"@MissAshes92 @doyle0213 Trainings have gone virtual, increasing access, not limiting it. Be the change you want to see! Volunteer to be on the CEM commission and work from the inside."
@doyle0213 States often have their own programs that are cheaper and have different reqs than national or international ones. Your friend should look at state certification.
"@doyle0213 Having an international certification program requires a lot of backend work that coordinates bodies of knowledge from around the world, to ensure that the right stuff is included for each region."
"@doyle0213 The CEM body of knowledge is based on those same competencies, for the USA version at least. The CEM program itself is certified as well, based on an international standard for certification programs. I chuckle at the idea that we make ""extra money"" on the program or gain members"
"@doyle0213 My two ISO certs cost me $100/yr each to maintain, plus whatever CEUs I have to get. CEM ends up being cheaper because it requires less ongoing training and more professional contributions the longer you have it. And it averages to less money per year."
"@doyle0213 Not true. You do not have to be a member to be certified. You do not have to go to conferences to be certified. You only have to pay the fee, take the test, and complete the other application requirements. And trust me, ALL certifications offered by a third party make money.."
"@doyle0213 And all of them count toward the certificate or recertification training requirements of most of the professional certifications (CEM, CBCP, CFP, some ISOs, etc)."
"@doyle0213 EFO is more on par with EMI's Advanced or Executive Academies, or the ELP at CHS. None of them are certifications though. They are all a program of study, which leads to a piece of paper."
"@egyp7 @TProphet And if you do survive, you may well have a vastly different quality of life than you did before."
@doyle0213 What else is there beyond the training? CEM and other professional certs require a lot more than just training. Which is why they have to have review panels and such.
"@doyle0213 The other option is for some other entity to create a certification and charge less for it. There have been some attempts, but it's hard to get people to do all the backend work for free, which is what low costs certs would require."
"@doyle0213 So in the tech industry, you have to pay for your training and the cert costs. In EM, you only have to pay the cert costs. It's much cheaper to be a CEM than many other things."
"@doyle0213 When I said tech, I was referring to technical certifications, like CISSP and stuff."
"@doyle0213 I'm not clear on your question exactly. You can get all the training you need for the CEM for free. Your professional contributions are on you though. Most governments CAN accept grants, which is why FEMA was able to pay for many certs last year via IAEM."
@doyle0213 Is it NFPA directly or something else? Idle curiousity mostly.
"@doyle0213 BTW, this is the exact same argument that exists in all of tech. Certs go to those who can afford them. It's a universal thing. IAEM did get a grant to pay for a bunch of local EMs to get them during the pandemic. And tech fundraisers often generate funds to pay for them."
@doyle0213 Is that a government issued certification for Fire? I know in our state it is. There's a big difference between technical government issued certifications and private ones. The CEM is the cheapest one I have at this point. Tech ones are crazy $$$.
@doyle0213 So the point in getting it is whatever you want it to be. Or nothing at all! It's like of like asking why an agency would become EMAP accredited. They found some value in it and went for it!
"@doyle0213 As with most professional certifications, the point is to show that you have mastered a body of knowledge. It some markets, it can make you more competitive in the workforce. For some of us, it's a marker of our commitment to the continued professionalization of the field."
@Just_Abbey oh my.
"@disastahguy @CNN Having the media tell their story can actually help generate awareness and aid. Prayers don't t add anything constructive to the response or recovery. They make the prayer giver feel good, but they don't or supplies or boots on the ground. Media coverage is vital to them."

"Finally got to an agent, after hours of waiting. Booked on  a red eye to Charlotte tonight, then on to Bham in the morning. Arriving 36+ hours late. Good job @AmericanAir"
So @AmericanAir shut their customer service counter last night before helping everyone they stranded in DFW. So husband has to go get in the line again and see if they are going to do anything all even remotely useful. Guessing not ...
"AND @AmericanAir WILL NOT give him his bags. They will either send them on to Birmingham if they ever decide to fly there again or they will send them home. So even if he finds another flight, no clothes. #AmericanSucks"

"@ktbass89 @AmericanAir Husband used the app to confirm a seat in tomorrow's flight, then booked his own hotel room. @AmericanAir is not interested in helping him get his bag though, so he's stuck with what he's wearing. He'll probably get charged by the hotel he's supposed to be in tonight too."

"@ktbass89 @AmericanAir Ugh. Husbands is gold for life on AA, but they suck of late."

"@ktbass89 @AmericanAir Not until tomorrow late afternoon. If they can't get him on that one, it will be Saturday."

"@MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle @murphquake757 Most of our CERT programs are on hiatus here because we can't conduct training. And CERT is just a public education program at the end of the day. Some places use it to create a volunteer pool, but many do not."
@MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle @murphquake757 There are plenty of other volunteer groups in communities. CERT is a relative newcomer to the game. All sorts of organized voluteer groups are out there that can help with this stuff. Look at your service clubs for starters.
@Southrn_Melle @MissAshes92 @murphquake757 One of the call centers I helped setup was staffed with employees who would have otherwise been furloughed.
"@MissAshes92 @murphquake757 mostly MRC and CERT. But it's a small community, so that's a significant number of the population."

"@irawinkler @iMeluny @DiscernibleInc Student debt is not low-interest, depending on when you got it and via what programs.

"@RealSexyCyborg Change, not chance. Ugh."
"@RealSexyCyborg To affect chance requires long-term messaging to change behavior. Public health has done a great job of long-term behavior change (seat belts, smoking, etc.) bud short term is very hard. Requires the message receiver to perceive benefit to themselves or someone they care about."
"@RealSexyCyborg In part, yes.

"@sopdet One of the beautiful things about building a database is that it doesn't really require coding. Sketch it out on paper, with the fields you want and how they related to each other."

It turns out there was something I wanted for my birthday and I didn't realize it. It was a text from @cmclymer. Totally made my day!  https://t.co/7rqezi1LF9
"I was initially very confused by this thread, but have come to realize it is hilarious!"

Changed a flight tonight (for several months from now) and the system apparently threw-up and dumped a segment. It didn't tell me though. @AlaskaAir noticed and called to fix it. :) #IFlyAlaska

"@CourtOfDisaster @SamLMontano @EMxSarah @AnthonyOnTheMap @jeffrubin2 @Jdlazo What is this break you speak of? But seriously, this is a cool idea."
Microsoft having services called Assure and Azure makes taking to their tech support overly complicated sometimes ...
"@aacevedo this made me laugh! I have raccoons who live here, but we don't see them much. They know how to navigate the yard without tripping the security lights. And luckily they do not go on my roof!"
@deviantollam this could work though if the shot goes in your ass.
"@aacevedo Heh. I'm very excited about having an owl out there. I want it to stick around, but I'm sure it's just passing through."
"The owl started hooting again. about about 3AM, which coincides with a security video of the asshole cat doing zoomies in the backyard. Maybe the owl will encourage the cat to go live elsewhere! There's also a bird carcass under the tree this morning, so owl has dined here. :)"
I probably can't adequately describe how excited I am about this! I stood out in the dark and listened to it for a while. I hope it sticks around until morning for photos. I've never gotten pictures of a Barred Owl before.
"We've lived here 15 years and this is the first time I've ever heard an owl here. It's camped out in the neighbor's giant tree. I can't see it, but can certainly hear it! #owls  https://t.co/76uISK5yo2"
"@walters_woody @hacks4pancakes There's a difference between being ""not racist"" and being actively anti-racist. From my perspective, it's the difference between assuming everything is fine and assuming we can do better and going forward from that perspective."
@jwiechers @hacks4pancakes I'm sorry. :(
"@DiscernedEd @hacks4pancakes There was no give and take. Student never talked to me, went over my head, then rage quit the program. The book though is Ethics of Disaster by Naomi Zack."
@jwiechers @hacks4pancakes Funny you mention that. I was discussing this with someone earlier today and specifically noted the cult-like features of some of this thinking.
@walters_woody @hacks4pancakes I see that as a piece of it. Lack of exposure to a wide variety of thoughts and ideas contributes. We're actively working on being an anti-racist college and that does cause some heads to explode.
"@jwiechers @hacks4pancakes I see it as two separate issues. The inability to think critically is separate from the echo chamber part, but they are often seen together. Correlation, not causation and all."
"@theEdAllMighty @hacks4pancakes No, public college."
"@hacks4pancakes I've taught for 18 years and it has gotten worse, partly because it's so easy to find your echo chamber and believe it represents the entirety of the world."
"@hacks4pancakes I teach college. At the undergrad level, the lack of ability to apply critical thinking and discern fact from fiction is very real. I got absolutely lambasted by a student because I forced them to read a horrible liberal book. It was a book on ethics. Basic ethics. Not political."
"Also, I have no idea how that is comfortable."

Just had a lovely chat with the @midlandUSA rep at the @iaem conference. I learned a new thing! NOAA weather radios are already capable of broadcasting earthquake early warning messages. Who knew?? (shush California). #iaemreimagined #iaem2020
"@MissAshes92 @crisistalker They rightfully said ""our house will be fine"", but had never considered the infrastructure that supports their existence. Camping out for a few days with no power sounded like an adventure. Pooping in a bucket did not. They evacuated."
"@MissAshes92 @crisistalker The choices we give them should be designed to help them make the right decision. We focus on leave or die, but we don't talk enough about post-disaster living. ""how long are you and the kids prepared to poop in a bucket"" turned out to be highly effective for a loved one."
@crisistalker @MissAshes92 My paper about this finally has a DOI and should be published and time!
"@crisistalker @MissAshes92 The key to getting people to take action though if to ask them to do one simple thing that is helpful to them or someone/something they love. The SSN thing does nothing to help them. It's not grounded in research, but rather in arrogance. It lacks empathy, which is key."

"@RSR_MeriDuniya @LiveLawIndia I mean seriously. How hard is it to figure out that the red headed woman wearing a face covering isn't a supreme court justice in India? Or do you just never, ever bother to look and see who you're tagging?"

@Nick_Lalone One of the schools I work with effectively did that. They contained a malware spread by disconnecting a single building from the rest of the network.

@Ready_Northwest @MissAshes92 They only ones I've seen are in 911. At least that I can think of.
@Ready_Northwest @MissAshes92 I'm confused. That job doesn't say it's entry level. It's clearly for someone with experience. Are you assuming entry-level because of the coordinator title? That's a very generic term.
"@ChrisDaniels5 Was trying to say ""now ambivalent"""
@Ready_Northwest @MissAshes92 Three years of experience is not entry level. Entry level is less than one year experience.
"@ChrisDaniels5 We've gotten used to it in hockey. I hated it, but am not ambivalent."

"@Ready_Northwest But right now, nobody can get training at all due to COVID. Places offering 300/400 are very much prioritizing people who HAVE to have it for their jobs."

"@therobdale @dave_doors @triecker And that's meteorology. Which is great for them/you. But it can be applied universally to professions that aren't meteorology. Not all professions can use that same metric. Such as EM, IT, cyber, and others that accept experiential learning as an entry point."
"@therobdale @dave_doors @triecker There are scores of IT and cyber professionals who are part of the IT and cyber professions , who have neither degrees or certifications. What's required is the ability to do the job. Same as EM."
@therobdale @dave_doors @triecker Your argument was that degrees and certifications are required for EM to be a profession. I just scrolled back and made sure I read that right. My argument is that those things are not required in order for something to be a profession. IT and cyber are the prime examples.
"@dave_doors @therobdale @triecker That's crap Rob and you know it by now. Try telling an IT or cyber professional they're not in a profession.

"@PDXYangGang @hellseathinks They did, as a direct response to the hot garbage coming from Q.."
"@ktbass89 @densaer I wrote something similar in my PhD program. From a policy perspective, it has always been hot garbage."
"@PDXYangGang @hellseathinks I'd argue that starting fires is very extreme. I've not heard any of those reports via the scanner or from family in the area though. Lots of rumors, but so far that's it."
@ericbergpdx I've also spent a lot of time measuring distances around there. It's probably not a healthy hobby. I was glad to see it slow though.
@chubbm I agree.
That's was a nope.. Iron even lower than last time.. damnit
Gonna go try to donate blood again. Crossing my fingers that I've gotten my iron levels back up to where they need to be.
@KrakenCrew_ @NHLSeattle_ The sloth was pretty cute. They had those when we were there.

"@jasonRredsox and from your bio, I can see that you don't approve of those  ""handouts"" to first responders since they are neither elderly or disabled, but they dedicated a LOT to help others and they deserved the support they were promised."
@jasonRredsox I've also had friends who responded to 9/11 contract cancer and now I've gotten to watch this administration gut the funds that were designed to care for them. So don't for ONE MINUTE tell me I don't respect the people who died or responded.
"@jasonRredsox The bad guys committed the act, but we made the choice to not prevent it. If you know something bad is going to happen, don't you have an obligation to stop it instead of ignore it? In my world, you absolutely do."
@jasonRredsox I have no lack of respect for the fallen. And we were at fault for ignoring our own intelligence services. Read the 9/11 Commission report. We 100% had the opportunity to stop it. Our leadership chose to ignore the it.
"Apparently I'm the only person in emergency management world who doesn't want to relive 9/11, thinks that Muslims and people of color were treated horribly in the aftermath, and thinks we gave away so many civil liberties that our nation is basically ok with 200K COVID deaths."
"@annanotation In general, I agree, but they're acting as a militia and trying to decide who can come and go and people are getting pissed/scared/etc. and calling 911, diverting cops to deal with them."
"Good god. Oregon cops having to deal with ""heavily armed, defiant"" people, who are trespassing, ignoring evacuation orders, and say they are ""hunting for antifa starting fires"". They're having to redirect LE resources from fire duties to deal with these assclowns."
"@JamesHDay It did,, but an excavation company and a bunch of volunteers dug firelines around the buildings (and others). And there were some fire engines. My parents used to live down the hill and went to church with them."

"I guess @FedEx has gotten bad at actual deliveries too. My delivery yesterday had a ""weather delay"". One a hot sunny day, with no fires near me. It was loaded back on a delivery vehicle 2 miles from my house at 0300, but has a ""pending"" delivery date. This is the second time ..."

"@metaljulie I don't know you, but I'm sorry that all of this happened to you. It's horrible to not be believed. And you know this, but I'll say it anyway. You were not at fault. He should not have been an asshole."
@kitchenmage Family is safe. Shirt-tale relatives are safe. Tracking a lot of homes lost among family friends. And watching as the three fires are about to merge where I grew up. Horrible.
"@kitchenmage I just measured a bunch of distances because it looks like three of Oregon's fire are about to merge into one, right where I used to live."
"@kitchenmage You can look up by address, then measure distance here:  https://t.co/FM6BkdfBm8"
This is exactly the story I needed today.
@BadassBowden I was crying at my desk night. Just little sniffles until my husband walked in and asked what was wrong. Then I could barely talk. ugh. And I'm mentioning liberally because it's ok to be sad and cry.
"@maxiesgal @BCWildfireWkly @Metcom_911 There's also the issue of your post office address being far away from an actual town. So they might have a Sublimity address, but not actual be inside the city limits."
"@maxiesgal @BCWildfireWkly @Metcom_911 It's actually the same now. Level 2 is Warning (be ready) and Level 3 is GO NOW (mandatory). The thing is that new fires are popping up that unrelated to the big ones, which is why some people are getting GO NOW when maybe they weren't expecting it."
"@maxiesgal @BCWildfireWkly @Metcom_911 These are the general evacuation areas. They probably got a knock because there was a fire encroaching on their specific location. Since they were at Level 2, they should have been ready to go when that knock came."
"@JimWhittington This happened for a while in Clackamas county last night. They actually said they were not going to try to fight some of it because they didn't have the resources. Including staffing, fuel, water. I heard them say ""we'll have to make do with what we have"""
"@arrowhags @Jortoise The Oregon ones were mostly started by a windstorm that caused power lines to spark. The only way to prevent that is to cut the power before the wind, which they have been trying in California. But shutting on the power in the middle of extreme heat also kills people."
"@arrowhags Canada does have massive fires, but they are further north, so it is generally cooler there. And can't water an entire state except with rain. Which there is a lack of. Climate change has made a big impact on when the rain falls too, so there's been extra vegetation die off."
"@Debbieotenburg @Ready_Northwest Yeah, I was listening to it. They were hampered by access and lack of resources. When they first dispatched that car fire that seems to have started it, the nearest available engine was in Estacada."
"@Ready_Northwest I heard the Spangler Road IC last night say ""we're going to try to keep it from jumping the road. We probably can't, but that's the goal"". They're just beat down and overwhelmed."
"Current evacuation notices for Marion County, with a link to Clackamas County. #SantiamFire #BeachieCreekFire #LionsheadFire #RiversideFire"
@knarphie @blenster That's accurate.
"@aw_weiland @STEWest So that was probably a very small localized fire. Not part of the 130,000 acres that's burned."
@aw_weiland @STEWest None of the Oregon fires are contained that I'm aware of.  https://t.co/LpGUWWZQWc
"@STEWest I just chatted with an EM friend in Bonney Lake. Fire is about 1 mile from them, but headed away right now."
"@STEWest I think the bottom line is that anything that catches fire anywhere in the county, people need to be ready to go because there's no way to control any of it. So everybody be ready."
"@STEWest I'm listening to the scanner. And these guys know they're losing the battle. Car fire turned into brush fire, which they can't contain. Evacs going just outside Oregon City."

@CO0483T @ericbergpdx @ksouth @Perronaldinho @pdxalerts That's how parents are sometimes. Marion County side is at Level 3 also though. Deputies are going door-to-door on the Clackamas County side right now doing evacs on Nowlens Bridge Rd.
Good fire data map from @Salem_Statesman  https://t.co/LpGUWWZQWc
@STEWest yep.  And I really didn't think there was that much left to unravel.
@STEWest Been having some convos with friends on the west side. And the reality when this over is going to unbearable. Both loss of life and loss of property.
Listening to the Clackamas and Marion County police and fire scanners. Just heard the coastal fire departments roll in to Clackamas county and get assigned.
"@Chimaera000 As a kid, one of my fav things there was their giant stamp collection!"

"@STEWest I spent 9 years in SAR on the west side of that mountain. Sometimes on that mountain. Everything up the canyon is gone from what I've seen/heard. I can't even image. Dad remembers the Detroit fire from the 50s, but that pales in comparison."
"@MaryJoFly @Jdlazo @karlfranz That was me last night! Slept with a bra on so I wouldn't have to fiddle with one in the dark if the power went out. Kept my yoga pants next to the bed, with a flashlight in the pocket and the big flashlight on the dresser."
@Jdlazo @MaryJoFly Last night was ugly here. During the day we ran out of fire units and were borrowing from the airport and the other half of the county.
@STEWest Thought you were central WA for some reason. Be safe. Fire is terrifying. Say hi to my mountain next time it peaks out though (that would be Jefferson).
"@MaryJoFly @Jdlazo Things really calmed down here tonight. Humidity is up from 10% to 28% and there's no wind at all currently. Still fires everywhere, but not the running kind."
"@STEWest Wait, you're in Oregon now? I'm gutted watching what's burned and going to burn. Everyplace I lived from birth to 16 (plus some of my 20s)  is in Level 3. So glad we moved my parents a few years ago or they would be in the middle of it. All their friends are though."
"@dna_heligrace Laundry hamper or laundry basket can make an ok cat carrier, as long as you can secure the top. My sis did that for her first hurricane after they moved to FL from OR. But I'm glad you got another carrier. Easier than the hamper and bungie cord method!"
"@soniagupta504 The newest level 3 evacs include every place I lived from birth to 16, plus some time in my early 20s. I'm so glad we moved my parents a few years back. They would be scrambling right now. Instead, they're hoping their friends and family make good choices and stay safe."

"My siblings and I are in a group text. None of us live there anymore, but we all have friends and other family there. Taking inventory of what we know to be lost already. Thankfully no people."
I just started looking in earnest at the fires in Oregon. And now I'm sitting at my desk crying. All the places I grew up around are burned or are likely to before night. So thankful we moved my parents a few years ago.
@ThePeacePastor They are a long way apart. The fires are many and huge.
This is heartbreaking. This is a tiny town. I used to live there. My parents lived there until about 5 years ago.
@MaryJoFly I know it was closed at the Oregon/California border at one point. Might still be. People going north were turned back to California.
"@cxi If you watch the cameras for a couple minutes, you'll see the airport crash rescue truck headed to that fire. Because we're getting low of fire trucks ..."

Humidity now 10%. 4 large fires across South King County. One being treated as two fires because it spans I5.
@TC_Johnson I know. But the math doesn't really work out that way ...
@TC_Johnson And you know that exactly nobody is going to save that extra money they get for the next 4 months so that they can eat come January.

@ltilbu @LanceEllisor @thesarahkelly Only congress can explain that.
@JoshuaRaines31 @LanceEllisor @thesarahkelly The interest accumulates on your loans for as long as you're in school. So the school is making cash and the lender is stacking up interest for as long as you're in school.
"@JoshuaRaines31 @LanceEllisor @thesarahkelly No, I was pointing out that the longer you stay in, the more money they make. It has nothing to do with interest. It's the cash they get from you sticking around as long as possible."

"@LanceEllisor @thesarahkelly And,  for federal loans Congress sets the interest rate. Which is currently 6.8%. Roughly double what the interest in my house is.."
"@LanceEllisor @thesarahkelly AND schools done exactly encourage to hurry and finish. Especially for-profit schools that have shareholders they need to make money for. So some of your loans can accrue interest for 10 years while you're in school, before you every see a bill.."
"@LanceEllisor @thesarahkelly The other thing that happens is if they are unsubsidized loans, the interest accrues the entire time you're in school. But you're not expected to make payments until you graduate. At which point all the accrued interest is added to the principle."

@Alisha_Beth It does not feel like it was slow at all.
Well there you go. Help save the post office.
@Alisha_Beth @USPS They've been removing USPS drop boxes in Portland this week. I don't even know what to do about this. My mom is missing multiple packages now that the USPS just simply can't find.

"Small business frustrations: 1 company won't pay me, 1 can't pay me because they haven't been paid, 1 forgot to pay me, and 1 has to be nagged to pay me every month. I've invested more time trying to get paid by the first one than I actually worked at this point."

"@obscure350125 @dildog Community college! Though we've dropped the word community from them here in WA, they're still affordable and they still provide great basic fundamentals, like math and writing."
@PreparednessJoe I got more in my month in DC than I have gotten total here in WA.
@electrifying Can I come to your house for dinner?
one of the highlights of teaching for @GeorgetownEDM is listening to students present their Master's thesis. Especially if you are the advisor!
@NHLSeattle_ That should also say former @TCAmericans netminder Carey Price. Gotta get all the Washington connections in there!
"@Sieve70 wait, what??? I've been working."
@Dank_H2O @MissAshes92 Yes. I've been teaching at the college level since 2002. Not only are the standards lower but they vary tremendously with geographic location.
"@MissAshes92 @Dank_H2O The GRE was so dumb when I took it. I started to study for it, decided it was stupid, and took it anyway. And it turned out that the University I was applying to required it, but they weighted it in such a way that I qualified for admission without it. It was a big waste of $$"

@cyrushabib @CharlotteGarden One of the reasons I love teaching at @GeorgetownEDM.

@chubbm @GabeLugoPIO It's the specific reason that people running national campaigns and doing fundraising ask the federal contractor question on their forms.

@CrunkComputing What I find odd is that people think non-profits shouldn't pay their CEOs well or that they shouldn't make a profit. They have to make a profit in order to support their programs. Every non-profit that needs to spend money needs to also earn money.
@CrunkComputing I still donate to a lot of charities. Even some of those charities. It's important to look at what they actually do. Goodwill for instance employs a lot of people and provides job training. Red Cross supports fire and disaster survivors for no charge. 1/

@MarcBarbiere @triecker @MissAshes92 @iaem @FEMA_EMI @SternJD I chaired IAEM's Theory to Practice working group of the Training and Education Committee for a while too. That group continues to push forward on this stuff too.
@MarcBarbiere @triecker @MissAshes92 @iaem @FEMA_EMI @SternJD The higher ed project has worked tirelessly on that for more than 20 years. They do a really good job of bringing academics and practitioners together for that purpose. BUT often the programs that most need to be there don't attend. They don't want to improve. They just want $$
@ldurf @MissAshes92 @MarcBarbiere @triecker @iaem @FEMA_EMI @SternJD @IAEMETC We're nerds who like science. Sometimes our tech is more about promoting things that promote science and other good things. We had talk about a disaster board game once.
"@MarcBarbiere @triecker @MissAshes92 @iaem @FEMA_EMI @SternJD We reinvent far too many wheels in this profession, either because people don't know how to get their info into the right hands or because those hands prefer to make new wheels . . . ."
@MarcBarbiere @triecker @MissAshes92 @iaem @FEMA_EMI @SternJD I think you misunderstood my response Marc. Ashley said she was going to research all the 50 states KSAs for EM reqs (or something along those lines). I was pointing out that she could collaborate with somebody who had already done it instead of reinventing the wheel.
@ldurf @MissAshes92 @MarcBarbiere @triecker @iaem @FEMA_EMI @SternJD This could be @IAEMETC Tech Talk. We often hunt for the great talks with a tie to technology that get rejected by the main conference. We had 120 people cram around our booth for one once. ;)
@MissAshes92 @MarcBarbiere @triecker @iaem @FEMA_EMI @SternJD My point was that you don't have to start from scratch. You could collaborate with the person who has already started this effort.
One more student loan down. Only four to go ....
@IanColdwater @KeirstenBrager Very interesting that they specifically say that! Why make a scholarship that specifically excludes non-binary people?
@MarcBarbiere @triecker @MissAshes92 @iaem @FEMA_EMI @SternJD There's an Advanced Academy paper in the NETC Library that covers this very topic!
@MissAshes92 @triecker One of my colleagues did that for his Advanced Academy project. He's not on Twitter though. I could connect you via other means though.
@triecker This is very true. One of the other reasons for it is that some programs were designed a long time ago and were never updated. I inherited a class three years ago that was still talking about the NRF.

@seattlemkh Claimed payment to an inside source for access. And why would you do such a thing knowing you're going straight to jail??
"@seattlemkh There was an interesting post from a reporter on Vice last night, which could be bogus, but they usually do decent reporting on such things, which claimed to have spoken with the culprits. Twitter made them take part of it down, which lends some credence to it. 1/2"
"@seattlemkh This is what baffles me about the whole thing. If you're going to go, go big. What was the point otherwise? The amount they brought in isn't even going to cover the bail money for the insider."
@k8hutton @GabeLugoPIO @doyle0213 Yep. I think the better choice would have been too shut the whole thing down for a bit. That way there would be no expectations of anything working..
"well, that was fun Twitter. I have an evening meeting and more work to do tonight."
@BorgDevil @MissAshes92 That only covers issuing a false forecast. It doesn't cover hacking their accounts or the service that those accounts are hosted on.
@k8hutton But is it getting the right engagement? That's why it's so important for communities to understand what platforms are actually used in their area.
"@AdreanMendoza20 @MissAshes92 I wholly disagree. Considering social media platforms to be public safety communications infrastructure is not the way to go. They are free services that we don't WANT more regulation of. The bad guys should be charged with whatever is on the books, but we don't need new laws."
"@AdreanMendoza20 @MissAshes92 But as a private service, for which they agreed to the terms, there's no guarantee of the service (whatever social media platform may be down) working at any given time."
@cmpriest One of our former cats developed a wicked limp after he lost a lot of weight. We just carried him around more.
@k8hutton Yep. And it's one of the few that can be accessed fully by non-account holders. Which makes it handy.
"@k8hutton I'm doing a mix of both tut-tut-tweeting and reminding people that they should always be thinking of other methods. Twitter is 25% of our population, at best (higher in metro areas). Opt in systems and other methods get better coverage."
@auburn_wa @pewresearch Good to see you're back from Twitter jail!
@MissAshes92 I'm not excited by this year. I want it to be done.
"@MissAshes92 Do you have an opt in system to reach your local community? That can be far more effective than Twitter since it's targeted. So can your Facebook page. Though I hate it, Facebook adoption is MUCH higher. 70%."
@WildCougar_ @soniagupta504 I was just coming here to say something like this. There's still drama to be had!
@MissAshes92 That isn't true. You have access to EAS in some way. That's the official way to send messages if you want people to get them. Only 25% of adults in the US even use twitter. We spend a lot of time dithering about something that reaches 1/4 of our population.
"@MissAshes92 Heh. I've spent 18 years teaching emergency and emergency management law. It becomes very complex, ESPECIALLY since every social media account that opens signs a waiver that acknowledges there are not guarantees."
"@MissAshes92 Private sector companies have safety related things to pass on. Would they be included? I think of say, the power company. Private sector. Not government. Or a private nuclear power plant. Not government."
"@MissAshes92 And right now, none of those verified government accounts can post, but their unverified PIOs can. So who's more important at the moment?"
@MissAshes92 It's subjective though. You have to write new laws that determine the importance of various social media accounts. You think government is more important. Kanye definitely thinks he is more important. And he has more money to throw into his cause than government does.
"@JBizzle703 I signed up for the tsunami stuff because I don't live in a tsunami zone, but I have family who does. I want to get their warnings!"
"@JBizzle703 EAS is still the nationwide official warning system, built into every cell phone, radio station, and local TV station. The only way you don't get those if you shut them off manually. Also, I keep a NOAA weather radio by my bed, for lahar warnings. 1/2"
@IanColdwater You probably just made somebody's head explode.
"@MissAshes92 Nope, because it would be subjective. Do you get a bigger sentence for hacking Kanye's account because he's popular or for hacking the NWS severe storm warning account because it sends official warnings? They're both verified. And officially official warnings come via EAS."
"@doyle0213 Pew research says it's anybody over 18, excluding you."
@JBizzle703 It's particularly useful for reaching the media. And for reaching savvy users with specific message. I get alerts everything the automated NWR Tsunami account sends a message. Which it can't right now.
"@JBizzle703 They better, since less than 25% of adults in the US even have a Twitter account. Twitter better be one of many paths for info dissemination."
@aetherlev Also evidence of MFA being bypassed.
@LethalityJane someone I know in ye 'ole Army separated their shoulder in December. Is finally being allowed to see an actual specialist this week. The delay is for what appear to be a lot of really dumb reasons.
@doyle0213 I'm just going to spend the rest of the day pointing out that less than 25% of adults in the US even use Twitter. We make it out to be far more important than it is.
@aetherlev And there's the underlying issue of blocking whatever access the miscreants had to get in in the first place.
"@aetherlev Yeah, you can see where people posted evidence of admin e-mails being changed. There's a LOT of cleanup work to be done."
@aetherlev The fact that scam tweets were going up almost immediately after they were taken down speaks to automation.
"@aetherlev All of it was ongoing, including when they changed bitcoin addresses. Unless it was an army of people, it had to be automated."
"@aetherlev Probably, since we essentially have none of the internal details. If you did a search on the bitcoin address though, before they blocked them, there were many, many unimportant accounts posting the same thing."
@aetherlev I agreed with point one. I disagree with point 2. They took over a lot of accounts that had few followers and probably didn't even notice.
@find_evil Some of us hate Python so much we would pay $5 for one line of code.
Less than 25% of the adults in the US use Twitter. 70% use Facebook. The smartest ones probably use neither ...  Thanks @pewresearch for the stats ....
"@shaundnichols @jack Twitter is one of many ways NWS sends warnings. They use the Emergency Alert System, which sends them straight to your phone/tv/radio in the affected area. Unless you shut them off."
"@MiltoriousCAT @CommsDom this is why we all must have cat backups. Though I never got the blue check, I have @buttersok who can fill in for me."
"@MiltoriousCAT @CommsDom wait, why can't you tweet? I see no checkmark."

"@SamLMontano This is a DM-a-friend-moment, not unlike the Calgary floods a few years ago. Calgary FD (I think) got locked out of their account for sending too many tweets. So the PD did them all on their behalf. It's still bad, very bad."
This is by far the best take I've seen on today's events. It totally checks out.
"@Jdlazo @densaer Or maybe they took them back down again. I saw one post that he could post, but that he couldn't reply to anybody. And then went radio silent."
@Jdlazo @densaer I've seen tweets from several now. Maybe a slow roll out?
"@JohnFleischauer yeah, they still clearly do not have their arms around the actual incident."
@disaster_dave @densaer Speak for yourself!
@JohnFleischauer I think taking the whole thing down is the better option. That way everyone knows they're not going to get info here.
@disaster_dave @densaer Nope. But yes on Biden and Obama. And Kanye.
This is the problem with a total lockdown of all verified accounts. Just shut the whole platform down Twitter. #smem #EMGTwitter
This is a big deal for official agency accounts. #smem #emgtwitter

@RayRedacted hahahahaha. Twitter is apparently no laughing matter today!
"@AlyssaM_InfoSec @BadassBowden @Viking_Sec At this point, I'm going to say Twitter could probably use the assist though. They seem to be ... in over their head."
"Here's the thing with the bitcoin scam. Yeah, it's pretty obvious. Except that people still get involved in pyramid schemes. People want to believe there's an easy way to make a buck. And it if only costs them a little bit to find out, they may well give it a shot."
@BadassBowden @AlyssaM_InfoSec @Viking_Sec it would also be cause for some stupid executive order demanding that social media be shut down for national security reasons.
@RayRedacted or fewer people with Admin rights on the inside.
@BadassBowden @AlyssaM_InfoSec @Viking_Sec Now we're all just waiting and watching ....

@DethVeggie I love the ones you're getting. I keep getting people asking if I want to use their company to hire more staff. I've gotten a little snarky with them ...
@KD4E_73 Good point. Wearing pants protects nobody.

Why does wearing a mask infringe on your civil liberties but wearing pants does not?

"@seattlemkh This is so exceptionally true, particularly in Washington. Sales tax is a key source of income for a lot of cities and it's not there right now. All the federal aid is to help with COVID expenses, but there's nothing to make up for the loss of revenue. Very hard choices coming."

@MarcBurdiss @SnarkyEM I totally agree. My point was the only reason they're doing anything at all is CMS. I have friends who got hired in healthcare EM jobs and didn't stay long because the org wouldn't spend money on anything that was non-billable. Our healthcare system is broken in many ways.
"@MarcBurdiss @SnarkyEM The joint commission EM rules are pretty much a joke. The CMS rules are better and have teeth, but they're in their infancy of being implemented."
@eTechOps All the masks I've been are non viable. The face shields are pretty good if you have access to mylar sheets.
"@bryanpackebush @SnarkyEM @MarcBurdiss Honestly, I don't think there was much of a plan. And if the was the plan, it didn't account for the gutting of the SNS. Another thought: hospitals had to be forced to even do EM..CMS rules only started requiring that about 3 years ago."

"@erikxwood I'm not talking about home tests. I'm talking about everybody mobbing to drive-thru test facilities, which are staffed by people using critical PPE that could be used for something else. I have far less issue with home testing."

All those supplies and PPE required for testing could be used by healthcare providers trying to save lives right now. T
"Can we talk about COVID testing for a minute?  I know people really want to get tested, but what's the exact point? The test tells you if you have now, not if you had it two weeks ago or might have it tomorrow. And if you do have it, there's no treatment. #EMGTwitter"

@PriestOutWest @TheFireTracker2 Problem is that many small schools don't really have infosec and are more or less winging it. Luckily both schools I work for pre-authorized Zoom a long time ago. But one of them I'm pretty sure never considered FERPA in any meaninfgul way.

@ShaunanKruse @Motley_Su @LakeWashSchools It's not crazy. The virus is endemic and the only way to slow transmission is to limit exposure to other people. Look at Italy right now. Same deal.

@EMgrB @triecker @seeleysue @dave_doors Most first responder orgs don't fully implement ICS that often. They struggle once they get into a second ops period. They never train for that.

"@dave_doors @triecker @EMgrB @seeleysue Had convo with someone last week where they are starting to change this, at least for key players. They will no longer accept the FEMA online ICS training certs, in lieu of a state offered in-class one with practical application."
"@dave_doors @triecker @EMgrB @seeleysue See my other comment. Plus, the actual required training is too short and doesn't include appropriate activities. And our organizations fight is on that. To do it right takes more time than they're willing to spend on it. At the end of the day, it's just not a priority."
@triecker @dave_doors @EMgrB @seeleysue My biggest issue as a city EM was staff turnover. We couldn't do exercised that built on the last ones because we had new people every time. The multi-year exercise plan for us never got beyond basics.
"@triecker @dave_doors @EMgrB @seeleysue And that's something unlikely to ever be solved. Most people who take an ICS class (because they are required to), will never end up using it on a large scale event where it actually matters. And so we have a steady stream of non-proficient people trying to implement a system."

"@triecker @EMgrB @dave_doors @seeleysue Healthcare has also tweaked it and calls it HICS. And part of the reason ICS struggles is because EOCs and similar things try to implement it and it was never designed for that. It's for incident response, not incident support."

@MaryJoFly FEMA has a model class for a Bachelor's degree on research methods. Guess what I'm teaching to a bunch of seniors in EM this term? Research methods. Because it's important.

@cmclymer At 16 my nephew did a multi-country road trip with us. He became the designated reader of stuff from the Lonely Planet guide. It shocked him as we got into countries where the guide said it was unsafe to be LGBTQ. He's straight and it was a moment of learning for him.
Great thread. Government never ends up with the best. For all the reasons in this thread.
@AlaskaAir We were in the air well before that posted delay time. Strange day at ATL I guess.
"This is odd @AlaskaAir. After all this dither, a delay popped up after the boarding door closed.  https://t.co/Mvg8Jsq1AP"
We're now at 8 minutes late. And finally closed the door. Whew! #iFlyAlaska
"Oh my. Now that's a gate agent on the plane, trying to sort out some sort of seat debacle. And I guess the lady who bolted isn't coming back. They just upgraded someone to get seat."
"Our flight home is supposed to depart in 2 minutes. Some lady just bolted out of her first class seat and got off the plane. Now there is a dither. Flight attendant just said ""there's a lot of chaos this morning""."

Only in Alabama would there be an argument about how many syllables are in orange.

"@dave_doors @GabeLugoEM Case in point: small city near me hired a new EM with experience in something sort of related. No education, tiny bit of training. Had to explain last week why the tiny landslide they had last week had zero chance of reimbursement. Person hired had zero understanding."
"@dave_doors @GabeLugoEM I think part of this argument is based on the idea that emergency response experience is the same as emergency management experience, when it is not. EM is the admin function that supports response. You have to learn to do research, write reports, write plans, write grants."
"@dave_doors @GabeLugoEM Been having this argument for 20 years. It's old. Experienced emergency managers are the only people who get to apply for jobs based on experience. If we only hire people with experience, eventually we'll run out of people. Education combined with an internship are how you get in"
"Big shout out to @Victorinox for replacing my broken wheel, even though I have no idea where my receipt is!"
"I figured out what was stolen!! It was an 8x10 print of a blue-footed boobie from our vacation, along with some address labels. @Shutterfly has already ordered replacements at no charge. And felonious sketchy dude gets a free boobie pic, which I doubt he'll appreciate."
"We subscribe to the daily USPS scan of our incoming mail, so we know what to expect. We watched the carrier come back this morning and add something, then we watched someone steal it."

@BadassBowden Welcome to the redheads who don't wear makeup family!! (My profile pic in an anomaly)
@brendanIllis The problem lies in that many parts of the country don't have any entry level jobs. A lot of them are one or two person shops and whomever gets hired had to know how to do everything since there's nobody to show them.
@chayne_s Landed in it. Left it. In Bham until Monday.
OMG! The group text message just came back to life. It won't die . . .
"So the seat is clean, but soaking wet now. But we're going anyway. Thankfully not my seat!!"
@TheFireTracker2 @Delta The what?
"And they just called for two more people to help with cleanup. I just saw a giant frappaccino cup go buy, so @Starbucks may be too blame for this @Delta delay."
"We should be taking off now, but cabin services just boarded to clean up a spill of some sort. We may never get to Birmingham at this rate."
"This @Delta flight is so cramped! I can barely get my backpack under the seat. Hubby couldn't get his to fit at all. And if the guy in front of hubby tries to put his seat back, there's going to be an issue.  https://t.co/6LpK40TPpf"
Not off to a good start for 2020 @AlaskaAir. Flight to ATL cancelled for crew rest. Choices were red eye or switch to Delta and still get there today. Went from row 1 to 26 and 42 respectively. Sad day!

@guamwatt That's where he's stationed. That's where he'll see a specialist.
@guamwatt Just checked. That info came from the Tricare hotline. I told him to call again and at least get them to ok pain meds.
@guamwatt Whatever region Washington is in. He needs surgery. I'll pass that on though.

"Husband and I reminiscing about NYE 1999. Both of us making OT, him in the NOC of a now-defunct cell company, me in a 911 center. By 12:01, it was clear the world was not ending. Hardest task was to convince them to let me go home instead of staying in the hotel they paid for."
@holly There were about six different knobs on this shower. Turns out two of them were actually buttons. That was the secret.
"@holly I don't know. Like, I should not have to ask how a shower works. I'm a grown-ass adult."

"Me: I'm going to travel less this year.  Work Schedule: 7 trips to DC, 4 to Vegas, 1 to Hawaii, 1 to Spokane, 1 to Reno. Personal: 1 to Atlanta, 1 to California.  Plus extended overnight trips to both Seattle and Bellevue for volunteer activities.  All that before October."
I suddenly understand why my nephew doesn't want to reenlist in the army. He seperated his shoulder on HBL. 3 days ago. ER gave him 5 days of painkillers and told him to get to a specialist. Army said no civilian treatment and no specialist until 1/9. So he's just SOL.
"Our healthcare system sucks. Now I need to see a specialist for something. Clinic full of specialists. Only one will accept me for this issue. Appointment is more than a month out. And oops, she's not covered by my insurance so I have to cancel."
I have a work trip to a fairly remote place in January. The nicest looking hotel option is someplace called the Antler Motel. It took me 5 phone calls to make a reservation because the office is open very limited hours. I'm definitely taking my silk sleep sack for this one.

So @ButtersOK just destroyed one of my living room window blinds because of the damned stray cat in our yard. I think he remembers the time he was able to get out that window (by smashing through the screen like Kool Aid Man) and go after an interloper.
I joined my local Buy Nothing group. I was worried it would be an odd place. It turns out I rather like it. I've gotten rid of things that I don't want/need/use and they're now in the hands of people who want/need/use them. It's rather lovely.

@RandiSanders17 Apparently not everyone got it at 0530. There was a randomness to when or if certain people in the group received certain things.
"Mom has started texting apologies to people. Including the ""we don't know you"" person, who she actually does know."
"our Arlos think they're dogs today. Everytime a trash truck drives by, every camera with a glimpse of it fires off. Usually, they ignore them. And it's double trash day in our neighborhood, so there are trucks constantly!"
"so from what I can gather, we're going to war with Canada over Home Alone? #SpiritOfChristmas"
There was also this lovely picture of a quilt at 0530 this morning.  https://t.co/czBmVDmXYn

"@MissAshes92 Universities sometimes have the full feed for no cost. But by and large, public safety lacks the skills to use it well. That's where the whole Dataminr debacle happened.."
"@johann8384 @MissAshes92 You can also use pre-canned solutions like Twitter Archiver or Creepy ( https://t.co/e4henXmONF) to do the pull, but you still run into the API limits unless you pay for the unthrottled feed. And nobody has the money for that."
@MissAshes92 This has gotten much harder to do because Twitter limits the number of Tweets you can pull via the API (unless you pay the $$$$$$$ for the full feed) AND people have gotten much more savvy about removing their location info.
@KhaledBeydoun I have a book called When Religion Becomes Evil. It's a decent read that includes most every type of faith.
"@Niki7a @deviantollam I very much appreciate this stance AND that DC is transparent about incidents and resolutions. Another org I'm part of has a secret squirrel mentality about it, so everybody thinks they're the only person experiencing harassment and hate. It's not healthy for the org."
"And now I'm trying to explain to my mom that she has zero control over other people responding to the group. She included someone who has a ""pay as you go"" flip phone, who is now out $$$ for all this."
The giant group text is the gift that keeps on giving. My great Aunt just e-mail me to tell me my Mom's phone must have a virus because she's gotten the original message 15 times ....
@Sieve70 I number I don't know sent a photo of a quilt at 0530. With BIL still in the loop . . .

It seems as though part of the @Twitter dumpster fire strategy is to punish people for public comments and reward them for private evil (by making private comments hard to report and not acting on them). Do better @TwitterSupport.
"Dear @Twitter, this is indeed a pattern. You need to do a much better job of suspending people who actually threaten people. Your platform is a dumpster fire of evil and misinformation. You could fix that, but instead, you toss the people who stand up for themselves and others."

@Jdlazo @onejavierromero @annamerlan One of the worst things I've ever seen on the main stage. The other presenters came to tell us they had nothing to do with the crazy people with whom the had the dishonor of sharing the stage.
@onejavierromero @annamerlan I'm pretty sure I've met those guys. @Jdlazo and I may have called them out publicly at a national conference. They blew is off in front of a live and broadcast audience. Were they using AI supposedly?!

@ThatCatBadger @ErnestHaffner @cmclymer I'm far more concerned about people having speaker phone conversations in the next stall.
@densaer Nice. My 15 year old niece did ground school last summer. Plans to get her student license in January.
@alixtrot @densaer I did a talk in ethics in disaster tech. One of my points was that we have to account for the people that our solutions don't help AND the people who are made worse by our solutions AND we have to fix our solutions or create additional ones. Have to do more than think about it.
@densaer I didn't know you were a pilot!! We have to meet someday in a non-virtual way.
"Existing network of people, vendors, and others to assist. Lack of ego (knows when they're in over their heads and willing to say so). JIT redundancies. Probably more, but those seem to be the highlights."
"The ""not great but ok"" side of the coin has a multi-disciplinary response plan that they've trained an exercised on. Ability to recognize and isolate an incident. Continuity plan that keeps basic functions going. Ability to organize. Willingness to seek and accept assistance."
Sometimes loss of key people mid-incident. Lack of organized response. Unwillingness to loop in everyone in the org who can help solve the problem (s). Ignoring or rejecting valid offers of internal and external assistance.
"I'm going to expand on this: shit widely encompasses the inability to quickly recognize an incident, lack of expertise to deal with it, lack of a list of people to call for help, no continuity plan (can't continue basic org functions like payroll), irretrievable data/work loss."
@erikxwood This is an excellent idea!
"Was asked about cyber AARs. Being a smartass I said ""I can sum up every cyber AAR in two ways: 1) we did something dumb, we had no plan, it all went to shit. 2) we did something dumb, we had a plan, things weren't great, but we got through it"". I think it's actually accurate tho."

"@Sieve70 Plenty of things have less than 2 hour notice, depending on where you live: lahar, earthquake, fast moving fire, landslide, dam failure, flash floods."
"@Sieve70 My folks live two houses from my sister, on purpose, but everyone is gone during the day. In think about this A LOT."
"@Sieve70 Most of my parents neighbors work during the day. Maybe all of them at this point. And in a fast moving event, there would be no way to get to my mom. There are only about 6 neighbor houses in a reasonable distance."
@Sieve70 And they absolutely won't move to places where there are others options because they are self-reliant. Except when they're not.
"@Sieve70 And then there's simple things. Like my folks. They're pretty self reliant, but they don't have extra cash and my mom can't drive anymore. If she got an evac order when my dad wasn't home and the neighbors weren't either, she'd be stuck."
@Sieve70 I can't tell you the number of times I had to explain to people that the big pretty mountain was actually a volcano that would someday try to kill them.

People are so clueless. We're in a very Asian airport lounge in HNL. It has no food. A couple came in. Asked multiple times if they had hummus. NO FOOD people.
I had to read a book called The Deadline for my project management class. It was horrible. Throwback to 90s tech industry. Now I have to find an airport lounge and take a test on it.

Off to Guam in the morning. It's a longggggg trip for one day of work.
@Just_Abbey I might should have used the word terrified instead . . .
I made a bunch of people sad today by making them Google themselves.
Getting ready to kick off a workshop on website and security guidance and best practices for @NWRSIA.
This is the funniest thing I've read all day. Good job @Popehat!

@CrunkComputing I know. I just don't normally wait until this last minute!!
"@BadassBowden Thank god you didn't! Somebody did that to me earlier this year and the ""flight"" part of my brain engaged. I nearly backed myself over an easel. In front of a room full of people. It was very awkward."
I have to deliver a presentation at 4 PM tomorrow on website and security requirements for a bunch of chapters of an organization. I have not even opened PowerPoint yet ....
@BadassBowden It's all perception! I think the fact that you didn't just launch and hug me and asked first was what stuck with me. My brain interpreted that as calm and restrained.
@BadassBowden Met. I MET a Katelyn in the middle.
@BadassBowden I actually feel like I a Katelyn in the middle.

Ugh @Hertz. You never checked my car back in at PHL last night. I can reach anyone there. All I can get is a nice woman in India. Who helpfully gave me the number for the Philly train station location. So I'm starting over.
So who is in charge of arresting people who enter a SCIF with a cell phone? Sounds like they're about to run out of handcuffs.
Ohhhhh. Canada mountains. That's a rare treat!  https://t.co/K2mdoUQYpb
Wow. Our @AlaskaAir flight is scheduled to land a full hour early. We should take the Canadian route more often! Downside is that there might not be a gate for us since we're so early.
"Interesting. Our PHL to SEA flight is taking a North route, mostly over Canada. Apparently very strong winds across the US."
@NucksNBirds @ChickfilA I hate that they are a @SeattleTbirds sponsor now. They can take their little sandwiches of hate and go elsewhere. I guess the upside is that any money they're spending on hockey promos isn't going towards causes designed to destroy the rights of people I love.

"@AlaskaAir She had a great conversation with your pilots! The highlight appeared to be ""I got to push a button!!"". Thank you!"
@bryanpackebush @AlaskaAir It was pretty cute when the flight attendant came back and told her it was a go. Niece got to tell her about taking private pilot ground school. FA was very encouraging about her becoming a pilot. :)
She just marched herself up front and asked if she could have a cockpit tour after the flight. Flight attendant called the pilot and tour is a go. She's apparently very exited to see the joystick that's used in an Airbus. Thanks  @AlaskaAir!
"My niece, the aspiring pilot, is sitting on our @AlaskaAir flight home doing her college trig homework. She's a high school sophomore. I feel mildly dumb . .  ."

"Sister number two only has a flip phone and it does not text. She not only missed out on the drama, but also on having her name and phone number shared with a rando. Parental persec is the hardest . . ."
with no immediate explanation are unsettling. All in the group chat  I finally apologized to the random stranger and welcomed them to the family.
Apparently my dad was in the hospital yesterday. He's fine. My mom has a wrong phone number for one of my brothers though and included some rando in the group text she made. And won't stop texting the group. And now my sister is pissed because sudden images of your dad in an ER

"Don't delay on this. And help your families out too. It took months to get my mom's birth certificate. My sister discovered errors on the birth certificates of two of her family members, which had to be corrected before ID could be issued."
"@hacks4pancakes @AnastasiaLeeV3 I've mitigated this risk by having a passport and passport card, plus my DL. I never travel without two forms of ID and I leave one stowed off my person and one on. Yes, cost extra. But my big fear is losing my ID somehow and getting stranded."
"@Moshcrates @hacks4pancakes @h4ckninja I'll retract a tiny bit of this. It's possible that some federal agencies are not compliant, but I think most are.  https://t.co/p7L63gqj6Z"
@hacks4pancakes @initinfosec I had been explicitly told by people who hired me that taking a passport was optional since CNMI is US Commonwealth. That turned out to be untrue.
"@hacks4pancakes @initinfosec There are also some other odd things happening. Going through TSA in CNMI, they would not accept my non-RealID driver's license. I pointed out the law didn't apply for another year. They didn't care. Had passport, passport card, and PIV, so was ok. BUT . . ."
"@Moshcrates @hacks4pancakes @h4ckninja A CAC card is HSPD-12 compliant, which means you can fly with it. Federal employee and federal contractor IDs are all compliant at this point as well, so can be used."

@WingzTeam I had a two week conversation with support. They could not assist or explain.
"I've had 2 drivers bail on me for this morning. My regular driver is available, but can't pickup on @SeaTacAirport property. And @WingzTeam prohibits the driver from picking up off-airport, for no reason. At least be honest with your drivers and customers Wingz."
"If I were a @WingzTeam driver, I'd be raising a ruckus. Barring drivers from getting pickups near the airport , when there's no regulatory reason to do so, seems illegal and meanspirited. @SeaTacAirport can't regulate what happens off their property, so Wingz shouldn't either."
"This new (unwritten) policy @WingzTeam has that forces all pickups near @SeaTacAirport to the airport is dumb. Customer service has ""no idea"" why it's happening, but someone does. Prevents any driver who doesn't have the airport stamp of approval from getting anywhere near it."

@AlaskaAir We finally started boarding again. It's all very irregular though.
@KiwiChief Concur.
Flight next to us is boarding with no issue. What's up with this TSA hold on 774 @AlaskaAir?
And all boarding had been stopped. Presumably by order of TSA. They used the word ordered when they announced it.
@KD4E_73 Haven't seen this in a long time
And we have to have ID to board.

@Responder_News @ValerieGMarlowe Sometimes things are a misunderstanding. I met a young professional once whose business card said CEM. I made a comment she didn't understand. Discovered that she had a Certificate in EM from a college. Put in on her card as CEM because she didn't know about the real one.
"@ValerieGMarlowe @iaem Yep. Looks like he has some other false credentials there too. Hopefully he'll take it down on his own. I suspect he confused the CEM with FEMA's PDS, but he doubled-down on ""Catrina"" instead of listening."

My flight to Portland Sunday on @AlaskaAir was delayed an hour and a half (for a 32 minute flight). My flight back to Seattle this morning to catch my flight to Charleston was just cancelled. So now I go a day late. This literally takes money out of my pocket that I can't recoup.

"@McSev One of the issues with this one is that normally the US would provide immediate aid, but most of our big stuff is already obligated to impacts here, plus some wildfires."
"@McSev I saw some videos and photos from during the eye, before the internet there went dark. Catastrophic is correct."
@McSev It's an alarmingly bad storm
@seattlemkh Which is precisely what science predicted. :(

@STEWest Beto has good thoughts on this.
"@pptsapper Yes. After I did a disaster deployment to Hurricane Harvey. I had an entire room just to myself. And I realized my ears were ringing non-stop. So the silence was a little ringy, but I still reveled in it!"
@ElizabethKingEM @STEWest Oof
@ElizabethKingEM @STEWest Glad your loved ones are ok.
@GretaThunberg You are awesome!!
@ProfLaurenDent @vanessaparks_ DM me and we'll set something up? This is passion and crusade! :)
"@ProfLaurenDent @vanessaparks_ BTW, if you'd ever like to video me in to your class as a guest speaker to talk about this, I'm happy to do it!"
This kid is awesome and brave.
@iAmTheWarax As it should.
@ar4v3n Heh. Going to the South is hard for me because everybody does it!!
@ProfLaurenDent @vanessaparks_ Cyber is the emerging threat for EM though. We're responsible for COOP/COG and supporting humans in every disaster. Infosec is not solely an IT problem. AND it doesn't matter if the incident was accidental or intentional. EM does consequence management regardless of cause.
"@ar4v3n It wasn't ma'am, so no."
@1dark0ne @Stickerum People just tell me things. Things I should not know.  It's hard to be smug though when you can't tell anybody else the things you know!
"@TheFireTracker2 Dry heat, just like my oven."
@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic Ugh. So many typos there.
"@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic AND, there's the financial issue. If my smaller jurisdiction opens up everything we have, that costs us a lot of money, which we never recoup if we're outside the disaster area."
"@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic Yep, but full is full and you have to keep driving."
@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic I remember a planning meeting where I started that my city in the valley way going to evacuate uphill in a flood. The uphill city said we couldn't. I asked if they understood human nature!
"@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic And that right there is exactly the point! In addition to your own population, how many evacuees and their pets do you plan for AND have capacity for? If an extra 1000 pets show up in your town, can you care for them or do they have to keep driving?"
"@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic Plan writing and plan execution are two different things. And for something like a Florida Hurricane, you're really asking GA, AL, SC to have plans, not Florida. At least for storms aimed mid--to-north Florida."
@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic I saw the Texas plan in action during Harvey. It kind of stunk. Closest human shelter to where we were was 40 miles away and didn't take pets. People trying to recover had to schlep. Many just left and never came back. It was nearly a week before I saw a dog.
@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic One of my grad students just wrote her thesis on animal sheltering. She found that local jurisdictions were doing a much better job of this than state level ones!
"@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic It's in most plans that I've seen. But again, the capacity that any one government has is less than their actual need in most cases. AND they are planning for their own population, not an evacuated population from elsewhere."
"@SarahDeYoung2 @MissAshes92 @CBRNEmedic The entire shelter system, for people and animals, requires multi-sector effort. It's more it less spelled out in the National Mass Care Strategy."
"@SarahDeYoung2 @MissAshes92 @CBRNEmedic Government can't provide sufficient people sheltering either, which is why the Red Cross is relied upon in so many places."
"@SarahDeYoung2 @MissAshes92 @CBRNEmedic Government usually doesn't have the capacity. Most partner with non-profit animal groups for animal sheltering. Here, we have contracts with the big national animal non-profits to run co-located pet shelters. It's not a service that government can do directly."
@SarahDeYoung2 @MissAshes92 @CBRNEmedic Even Airbnb gets on-board with pet-friendly disaster housing! But you also have to been a bit more savvy to access it.
"@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic It's some of both. There's limited capacity for pets and they fill quickly. So you just have to keep going further, whereas if you didn't have pets, you might find something closer that wasn't yet full."
"@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic Also, what might have previously been a 4 hour drive might be 10 simply due to traffic."
"@MissAshes92 @SarahDeYoung2 @CBRNEmedic It has changed, but it's capacity issue. In Texas, you can go multiple directions to evacuate. In Florida, you can basically go one. And much of that one direction is under evac orders also. When fam with pets left Florida for Irma, one went to TN and the other to AL. Long drive"

"@actualreverend @CoconinoSheriff @NAUPolice My main beef is that the most likely places for people to get lost in the US are also places that have no cell or data coverage. And if they do have coverage, their lat/long is transmitted with their 911 call."
"@actualreverend @CoconinoSheriff @NAUPolice Oh God. I just had a huge flap on the Facebook with somebody about this. It's cool and all, but I don't think we need yet another thing for our 911 call takers to have to deal with. Maybe other use cases though."
I think things got a little crazy in ATC when we were taxiing around still too. We made a VERY hard stop. I looked out and there was a giant Lufthansa plane close and perpendicular to us that had just done the same thing. It turned it's lights off and we continued on.
"And we're on our way!  Overhead bin door popped open right after takeoff. Flight attendant had to jump up and secure it. Assuming nothing else happens, arrival delay will be 2 hours 17 minutes. #iFlyAlaska"
@DisasterEeek I thought the same until I came across those skunks!!
Here we go for real!!
@DisasterEeek Be sure to watch for the little skunk family. They are adorable!
@McSev Ohhhhhh. That also means an extra day of per diem! Silver lining.
@McSev Luckily I don't have an early meeting tomorrow. It will be well after midnight before I get home.
"Also, I'm hungry. Really hungry."
@AccessRadioDJ People had almost two hours in which to get off! A mom and kid did. The rest of us stuck it out
"Finally taxiing around the airport. There are planes parked *everywhere*. It looks like everything that can be considered an empty space has a plane in it. We are now one of them, with an ETA for actual takeoff of 21:18."
The door did in fact close. But there are so many planes sitting around we can't push back. Been on the plane 2 hours now.
Woohoo! Door closing!!
Been sitting on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes. I just hope the crew doesn't time out or anything . . .
@McSev At least then I'd have a snack and a drink!! I love watching thunderstorms from the air though. So amazing!
@McSev It was super nasty!! And we're still sitting here in the backup . . .
I think every kid on the plane just went up for a cockpit tour. At least the pilots aren't bored now.
Interesting. The final passenger just got on this plane. We were supposed to leave nearly an hour ago. Heard convo from crew that she had a major TSA hassle. She's young too. Clearly a teen  The delay worked out for her at least. Though the hassle did not.
OUCH. New ETA is that we'll leave in 50 minutes. That's a big ATC delay. And I'm really hungry. #iFlyAlaska
"The storm has cleared and everybody is back out on the ramps. But there's a huge backlog of flights waiting for final prep and a spot in line. Our last ETA for departure was 5 minutes ago. Door still open, pilots roaming around looking bored."
"I've been to the Auschwitz memorial. I read the names of people who had the same last name as my family. I don't know if we were related, but I know they were murdered there. The young people on our trip thought every person their age should visit and learn."
"Yikes. Just when it looked like the weather was going to clear, lighting strike just off (or maybe on) the tarmac."
@AdrienneSMcCord @AlaskaAir Me too!
Best thing about coast-to-coast evening flights on @AlaskaAir? Ice cream!! Of course this weather has to clear out first . . . #iFlyAlaska  https://t.co/6YgcGPyJXl
"Heard a rumor that the internet is down on this plane too. That will make for a long, boring flight."
Pretty sure there's a ground stop at IAD. Lots of lightning!
@AlaskaAir I'm shocked to still see people on the ramp! I love a good lighting storm though!
@AlaskaAir Big crowd to ground lighting just off the airport. The kind that shuts ramps down . . .
@AlaskaAir Everyone is wearily eyeing the sky. But we're boarding.
I would not be surprised if this @AlaskaAir flight gets delayed a little more. This just rolled over the airport.  https://t.co/RESJwBdPOd
"This is a stupid and dangerous policy @hertz and you'll end up getting someone killed. You should stop doing this yesterday. Also, lesson learned, watch the dashboard when you start the car. It told me it was limited, but I didn't see it. 5/6"
"Preventing a car from reaching the legal speed limit is ridiculous. I thought I was going to get run down by a semi that barreled up behind me. Yes, he should have backed off, but I should have had the option to speed up and give him space. I didn't. 5/"
"They programmed the car to go to faster than 65.  It also beeped every time it hit 50, 55, or 65 and popped up a message that had to be cleared. Not only was this hugely distracting, but also dangerous. 4/  https://t.co/x7J6k7YkD5"
"WTAF is a vehicle top speed?? Then I hit 65 and realized this was not a limitation of the car, but a choice by Hertz. 3/  https://t.co/gUpCYYMh1J"
"WTF is that? And this is displayed on the info screen.  I thought this odd, but mostly annoying. Then I hit 55 MPH. 2/  https://t.co/x7YXnFGml3"
"Here's a little story about the @Hertz #nannycar, produced by @Ford. Hertz programmed it for a top speed of 65 MPH. I rented it at IAD. The speed limit in parts of PA and VA is 70. I didn't note the car's limit until I got on the freeway. I hit 50 MPH and beep, beep, beep. 1/"
Always fun times with a thunderstorm at the airport. At least I got upgraded so free drinks when we finally board!

@Hertz I have this car for a day and a half. I don't have time to try to sort out a swap.
"Really @Hertz? A speed limiter on my car? Bad enough it only has AM radio and the dash looks like it's wearing somebody's coffee, but a speed limiter too? FTR, it's set at 65. The speed limit in places around here is 70. That's just plain dangerous."

@Stickerum @hacks4pancakes @Gillis57 Valid question!
"@Stickerum @hacks4pancakes @Gillis57 Well, I was the married woman in the story, so sort of!"
"@rowena77 Part of the issue is that I had email confirming my seat and upgrade on Flight 3. When they cancelled Flight 1, I was in no hurry since I knew I had a seat. Which was then cancelled."
@disaster_dave SFO. To PDX. To sleep on the floor. To SEA in the morning.
"Well, I'm finally on a plane. Going to a city I don't want to go to. At least I'm first class and they have Woodford."
@hacks4pancakes @vmyths I played such a fun one! I can't remember the name right now because I've been stuck in an airport all day and my brain is fried. But it was made by @TakoubaSecurity.

@rowena77 But thank you for looking
"@rowena77 I can't get there at this point. I'm about to board for SFO, then PDX. Had that told me that two hours ago, I could have made it"
@McSev Thanks. I'm not getting home until tomorrow now. A full two weeks after I left.
@AlaskaAir I'm going to send the entire timeline to customer care after I get home.
@hacks4pancakes @Gillis57 Indeed! And I still wonder what happened to him.

"@AlaskaAir The thing that deserves an explanation on all this is how I went from having a confirmed and upgraded seat on Flight 3 to having no seat at all. I don't expect you to figure it out, but somebody should..  https://t.co/4BTiUQxJG1"
@alisonmaclellan Except  https://t.co/KbGTMEomQe

Turns out the later @AlaskaAir flight wasn't cancelled. My seat was. So now I'm going from DCA to SFO to PDX where I will spend the night and fly home to SEA tomorrow.
OMG. The later @@alaskair flight is now cancelled too. Right now I'm slated to spend the night in PDX via SFO and get home tomorrow. I also have no idea where my bag is. On the line with a CSA who is trying to sort it out.

"Bah. Another 3 hour delay. @AlaskaAir could have flown a new plane in by now. If it does end up getting cancelled, I do have a first class seat on the late flight. Would rather have spent the day in a museum than in the airport though, if going home isn't an option."
"I just realized I can see the @AlaskaAir gate from the United Club. We're supposed to start our delayed boarding in 7 minutes, but there's no plane there. I'm staying put til I see a plane!"
"@AlaskaAir I know. Honestly, I would rather fly in a plane where all the parts are working, so I'm ok with that part. :)"
"@AlaskaAir A guaranteed seat on the later flight just popped up on my app, so that's good. It's a horrible seat, but it's a seat! So I'm for sure getting home today."
@EmergPrepGal Yes she is!
"@AlaskaAir I talked to them. That's how I know the worst case scenario. The seats for the evening flight are all being held now in case this one gets cancelled. Since I have status, I would almost certainly get one of those seats."
"Double meh. Update is that we'll get another update from @AlaskaAir in 2 hours. I'm definitely missing the kick-off of my husband's birthday party. Worst case, I end up on the evening flight. I would get home late time."
@Responder_News Ewwww

@fr12947214 @anjel2569 Yes. Those organizations charged with carrying out the Mass Care Strategy who have tried to intervene have gotten nowhere. In no scenario is CBP supposed to have anything to do with mass care. They're not equipped or trained for it.
@fr12947214 @anjel2569 It has existed since 2010 and has been used in every large emergency and disaster our country has had since then. We don't normally have to talk about it because the organizations that are a part of it are allowed to just do their jobs. This time they are being blocked.
@poplifegirl I figured! I'm working in letters now. Will share . . .
"@densaer It seems that we have to do everything we can to change that. I'm just not sure what ""everything"" is."
I think maybe an educational letter writing campaign to elected officials is in order.
"It should be getting heavy use for the Border Emergency. It's an apolitical document that says HOW we will care for people, regardless of why. It's not being used and people are suffering. As a country, we KNOW how to do this right. Why are we not?  https://t.co/4ZUBDWdN0w 2/2"

"@guamwatt Eh. We've already had two gate changes. I'm done tromping around the airport! I have my battery pack, I just like to hm save it for emergencies. Which I guess this became!"
What I really want after an 8 hour flight is a power outlet. HNL seems to be devoid of them.
"@bryanpackebush Me too! TSA at Guam didn't recognize the RealID extension for Washington, then we had to clear US CBP to leave."
"This trip required ridiculous number of customs &amp; entry forms, considering we never left the US. Hawaii = 1, Guam = 2, CNMI = 1, and now USA =1 (upon return to Hawaii). It also required multiple presentations of my passport, which they told me I didn't need to bring (but I did)."

@find_evil I would have paid to watch that.
@find_evil At least he knew he did wrong!
"Technology is so awesome! I'm in the airport lounge in Guam. I hear a smartphone say ""is there a machine to warm the bread""? A man wanted to make toast, but did recognize the contraption on the counter as a toaster. So he used his app to ask the attendant. And now I smell toast!"

"@phildavis55 @KeithKOMO4 @komonews And for small businesses and non-profits, using cloud hosted email as opposed to a server in the closet is the way to go. Leaves pros running the security AND your email isn't lost if you do have an incident. Non-profits can get Office 365 or Google Enterprise free!"
"@phildavis55 @KeithKOMO4 @komonews Using antivirus software is important, but they all essentially scan for the same things, so you go with the one that offers the features you like best."
"@phildavis55 @KeithKOMO4 @komonews The best defense against malware (including ransomware) is good online hygiene. Don't click links unless you're certain of their content, don't open emails from unknown or suspicious senders, don't plug in USB storage devices that aren't yours, use pop-up and ad blockers."
@phildavis55 @KeithKOMO4 @komonews For what purpose? Security software is a really broad concept!
"I just did an interview with @KeithKOMO4 at @komonews about ransomware and cybersecurity. Not sure if it will get used, but it was an unexpected twist to my day."
"@STEWest Yes. Exactly. If power is killed on the hottest days, people have no AC. In rural areas, they no place to go."
@STEWest Me too. This is going to kill people.
@STEWest Oregon's company is staying they're going to do it on all red flag days in Eastern Oregon. Crazy.
"@STEWest Per everyone I've talked to, the power company decides. Their attitude is ""we've been telling you for 6 months that we're going to do this, you should be prepared""."
"@STEWest Seems like in California, really just since last year. Oregon is about to do it for the first time."
Ohhhhh a job opportunity. Do you think I should go for it fam??  https://t.co/3th1BlO6ht
"@MaryJoFly @josephporcelli @SDGE Which is great for what it is, but doesn't help with AC or medical equipment."
@josephporcelli There is so much wrapped up in this. Just talked to somebody who thinks the power companies are trying to use it to change the law to give them immunity for fires.
@TheFireTracker2 It's spread to Oregon now too.
"This is particularly relevant in rural areas, where there's no place to go for cooling and people don't have the means to buy their own generator (such as my parents). We're taking vulnerable people and saying ""figure it out"". #EMGTwitter"
"I have strong feelings about power companies killing power during high fire danger days. They are not good feelings. I get that they don't want the liability of starting fires, but how are people supposed to deal with no AC and no way to keep their food cold? Discuss. #EMGTwitter"

A glorious day for flying! Hello @mtrainier! Thanks @AlaskaAir for the flyby. #IFlyAlaska  https://t.co/fUQ64Dbton
"Weird. Our @AlaskaAir flight is out of @SeaTacAirport A gates today, all the way at the end. Flight attendant she commented that in all the years she's worked here, she's never been to this end of the airport!"
@RachelTobac This is magnificent.
Ohhhhhh! My Arlo just captured a mama raccoon with two babies scooting across my driveway. Soooooo cute!
@AlaskaAir Yep!
"Something confuses me @AlaskaAir. Red eye the other night (SAN/BWI), no blankets. Morning flight today (BWI/SEA), blankets. Why not on overnight flight?"
"Yep, 45 minute delay. But we must not be facing a strong jet stream. Only 8 minute delay into Seattle."
"I think my flight is about to be delayed. Supposed to board in 4 minutes, but no gate yet and it doesn't appear the inbound is here yet."
"@badsynthesis @pittman_barry @DanielMiessler @manicode And taking this a step further, a pentester also knows they can't reveal anything they see or find except within very limited parameters. Usually just to the people who asked them to test in the first place. Further distribution gets you fired and blacklisted. Same with people."
I just found out there's a @BSidesVI. Now I want to go! That's a quick and lovely ferry ride.
@DtotheTubbs @BlondeinKevlar I used to report to an Asst. Chief. He never made traffic stops. Ever. He was late to our staff meeting one morning because someone blew the stop sign in front of the station and he nearly hit her. He felt obligated at that point . . .
@badsynthesis @pittman_barry @DanielMiessler @manicode Because some people can't comprehend the idea of consent. Which is weird for a pentester. They know they have to have consent to do legit pentesting. They know there are consequences for doing things to systems without consent. Same applies to people.
"@pittman_barry @DanielMiessler @manicode And you're right. If you can't respect that other people make their own choices about their own lives, Defcon probably isn't for you.  22k people make a lot of interesting choices.  Most of which are of no concern to anybody but them."
@pittman_barry @DanielMiessler @manicode You get to respect your body as you wish. Your don't get to dictate how other people respect their's. It's that simple.

I either just got scammed out of $20 by a guy who said he's a Marine or I bailed an actual Marine out of a jam. I'll know by the end of the day ....

@MissAshes92 @triecker @Southrn_Melle Theory vs practice. We need both!
@Southrn_Melle @MissAshes92 Bingo!
"@MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle Cool! My state has no certification. Hell, we barely have a state association. I haven't been able to pay my dues in a year because their website is broken and they won't tell anybody how to pay!!"
"@triecker @MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle No worries! A couple of weeks ago, somebody who tried to get their CEM 15 years ago (and has since retired) cornered me at a conference to bitch about the degree requirement! :P"
"@triecker @MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle I don't disagree! Though I can't speak to the state piece, just trying to meet people and make a network was hard."
@MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle Yep. And that's what trips up a lot of people. They want response years to count the same as EM years. Different job . . .
@MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle But they do want the TEM that has the same reqs as the AEM and that the same person with 5 years experience also can get.
"@MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle I remember talking about it somewhere publicly right after they changed it. Some guy was pissed because he didn't have a degree. I asked ""why didn't you apply last year then"" and he really has no answer. He just wanted to bitch about it!"
@MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle I know. It's just an old argument. 15 years old in fact!
"@MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle They should have applied with 20 years of experience, before there was a degree requirement!! Also, we have the AEM for them. Many states have their own certs, though it's not a substitute. It's a different cert."
"@MissAshes92 @Southrn_Melle Hopefully the people dropping membership are joining your state association. I've found that most people who drop never took the time to get involved, thus got very little out of their membership. Part of my job as Region president is to ask everybody who leaves why!"
"@MissAshes92 @triecker @Southrn_Melle Have you asked? If you send a note to info@iaem.com, they can provide a lot of specific info. In general, this is the first price hike in many years, so you can sort of do the math related to cost of living since the last increase."

"@tamer_hadi @MaryJoFly @MissAshes92 @Clim8Resilient @iaem @IAEMETC @EMCESA I have three different, complimentary, certifications. One of them is the CEM.

@Clim8Resilient @MaryJoFly @tamer_hadi @iaem @IAEMETC @EMCESA There was only one level of credential for a long time. Now two. Maybe someday three!
@MissAshes92 @Clim8Resilient @MaryJoFly @tamer_hadi @iaem @IAEMETC @EMCESA There's a movement afoot to start a caucus for small organizations. It just takes a few people to get things moving.
"@MissAshes92 @Clim8Resilient @MaryJoFly @tamer_hadi @iaem @IAEMETC @EMCESA The T&amp;E committee does a lot of work around theory-to-practice, which deals directly with that bridge.

"@MissAshes92 @Clim8Resilient @MaryJoFly @tamer_hadi @iaem @IAEMETC @EMCESA What do you want to get out of your IAEM membership? People find the most value in the caucuses and committees, but only about 1/4 of the members actually join one."

"@Clim8Resilient @MaryJoFly @tamer_hadi @iaem @IAEMETC @EMCESA The CEM was the baseline for a long time. After adding the degree requirement for it though, a lot of people were excluded. The AEM is the entry path to the CEM. This isn't an unusual model in certifications. The first level is ""working on it"", the middle level is ""got it"""

@Clim8Resilient @AnthonyOnTheMap You'll find caucuses using Slack and Basecamp as communication tools. I think soon we'll have org wide tools.
"@Clim8Resilient @AnthonyOnTheMap The value of the organization is largely in it's caucuses though. That's where people find common interests. The new job board offers third party refine reviews too, though it's only been live for a couple of weeks, so I haven't talked to anyone who's used it yet."

@mistressmatisse @deviantollam @ENBrown I was pointing out that not every sex worker every time is arrested. I pointed to the Seattle case(s) as evidence of that. I'm making the point that some parts of the country are treating these cases differently. I don't need to engage in debate about it. At all.
I'm talking about the Seattle case and have been the whole time. I'm not arguing the Florida case at all. I've read both articles. Florida = arrests. Seattle = services and visas and no arrests.
"@deviantollam @mistressmatisse @ENBrown yeah, it says 5 people were arrested. None of them being the sex workers. The Stranger is typically pretty accurate on such things."
"@mistressmatisse @deviantollam @ENBrown She's also quoted in the Stranger article, which makes no mention of any of the sex workers being arrested.   I do doubt your take, based on the fact that Visas are being sought for them. Being charged with a crime generally removes the possibility of a visa from the table."
@mistressmatisse @deviantollam @ENBrown what's your source for the part where they were arrested at all?
"@mistressmatisse @deviantollam @ENBrown Also, can you point me to your source for the Seattle incident that says they were all arrested? I'd like to read the counter narrative."
"@mistressmatisse @deviantollam @ENBrown So i'm confused. You read the article I posted, that said they were not arrested, were offered assistance, and were told they're not being deported, and you're saying that either didn't happen or isn't true?"

@deviantollam @GdsCleo @mistressmatisse @ENBrown I honestly don't know. I'll have to find out! I suspect it may vary by country. I can imagine in some countries they would not be allowed to exist with such a policy in place.
"@GdsCleo @deviantollam @mistressmatisse @ENBrown This last year, there was new training for leads and a process for suspected trafficking victims because a couple were rescued the year before. Somebody realized we were in unique position to help, but only if we didn't screw it up"
"@GdsCleo @deviantollam @mistressmatisse @ENBrown There are so many anti-trafficking things quietly going on out there. Most of them slide under the radar, which is how they can remain effective. I volunteer at an annual free clinic that serves thousands."
"@deviantollam @GdsCleo @mistressmatisse @ENBrown So the organization I volunteer with is @soroptimist. I'm the current president of @sicascadia.

"@deviantollam @mistressmatisse @ENBrown I posted the link somewhere in this thread, but the most recent was three days ago. Covered in the PI and other outlets."
"@GdsCleo @mistressmatisse @deviantollam @ENBrown Yep. I work with a nonprofit that does a lot of education about human trafficking. It's sometimes very hard to change people's minds and get them to view trafficked people first as people, then as survivors/victims. Some people can't get past what they see as a crime."
@GdsCleo @mistressmatisse @deviantollam @ENBrown Agreed. I think the approach changes dramatically depending on what part of the country you're in. Some places are more inclined to treat people humanely than others.
@mistressmatisse @deviantollam @ENBrown This is not universally true. A ring was just broken up in Seattle and those women were not charged with crimes. They were connected with social services and help. Some places recognize that trafficked people are not criminals.

"One of the guys in the group walked over with a good sized unmarked box and plopped it on my table. He lead with something like ""I hope this isn't weird . . ."" Turns out the box was full of pink carnations. The group was a bunch of florists, attending a florist convention. 3/5"

@MlleLicious @Niki7a @liamosaur Exactly. They're not an expert in that topic. They should have clear guidance that they are not to address things they do not know anything about and they should have a process for who to go to with questions.

"@Niki7a @liamosaur I agree he handled it well after he ventured into territory he had no business in. Cluelessness from my perspective is not a reference to intellect. In this case, it's both a reflection on the company having bad polices and guidance for their public facing employees and on 1/2"

"@zillahockeyclub @ericaberry2001 We drove the speed limit from Showware to home, basically up central to Auburn way. The hard part was getting in the garage. I can't make the corner in 4WD because it won't turn sharp enough, but I needed the front wheels to push me in. Took two shots, but it's in!"
My fountain looks lovely. #SnowMageddon2019 #AuburnWA  https://t.co/vro6gQb7bt

@cybersecuriTiff Now I'm thinking this could be an interesting #defcon talk ...
@cybersecuriTiff exactly how it might affect them. That can be the trusted messenger explaining their own experience. Another tactic is showing how their action (or lack) affects the people they care about. My Aunt enabled 2FA after understanding risk to others.
@cybersecuriTiff I teach an entire graduate class on this exact topic! it is the bane of risk communicators everywhere. Part of the solution is for the message to come from people they perceive to be like themselves. And part of it is for them to see or experience a clear illustration of 1/2
"@cybersecuriTiff They have to personalize it. Most people hear the risk and ascribe it to somebody who isn't them. They understand that there is risk, but internal bias tells them they are safe from it, but other people should definitely be taking action."
@cybersecuriTiff This is why I'm both an emergency manager and a cybersecurity manager! The parallels are striking.
"@ShaunanKruse Also, this isn't panic! Panic is a lack of constructive action. People are taking steps in relation to the storm that they believe are needed to keep themselves safe and/or comfortable. That's the opposite of panic!"
"@ShaunanKruse Yes and no. People perceive this to be a huge risk to them, so they take action. They don't perceive an earthquake to be an actual risk, since they can't see it or any evidence of it. So their internal bias tells them they're safe."
"I just hope the earthquake that could actually hurt people happens next week, while everybody is still stocked up .... 3/3"
"""Particularly perplexing is that even risk events with minor physical consequences often elicit strong public concern and produce extraordinarily severe social impacts, at levels unanticipated by conventional risk analysis"" (Kasperson et al., 1988).  2/3"

"@Rubonist My smallest city is 7000, my largest about 110k."
@Rubonist It's a medium city with a fairly small government. Pretty typically of Seattle suburbs. Very wealthy and everybody commutes elsewhere to work.
"@Ready_Northwest That is basically an annual event, but it's more a tabletop and the people who might get the most from it don't come."
@Rubonist About 65K.
"@Rubonist There is. A request was made today, through non-standard channels, to get some resources. And they're getting help. But had there been a plan, tested and vetted through both IT and EM, I think maybe it would't have taken a week AND it might have gone through the normal channel."
"@Rubonist By way of example, this current city has one IT staff person right now (sounds like maybe the other one quit mid-incident). They have to reimage 120 machines and rebuild their network infrastructure. And those things have been gone for a week now."
"@Rubonist So for instance, if the water system can't distribute water anymore due to a cyber incident, ICT is going to fix that, but they're not going to arrange for shelters, water delivery, hospital re-routes/shutdowns, etc. That piece of consequence management falls to EM."
"@Rubonist I have a lot of really small cities around me. They might have one person to do their ""computer stuff"". And that person is good at that job until something really bad happens. And they usually don't have the skills to deal with the human impacts to either employees or the public."
"@Rubonist Also by ""you"" I meant the organization's overall plans, not any specific silo."
"@Rubonist If planning is not done collaboratively with EM, there's no clear path to the consequence management of the stuff that goes beyond the ICT sphere. And worse yet, small cities often have no plans at all. EM can get the discussion started."
"@Rubonist That has to be part of the discussion. One of the biggest problems I've seen in small orgs is that ICT doesn't recognize the complete impact of failure, nor do they have the responsibility or ability it deal with the cascsding consequences."

"So my assumption is that when they deleted the type of luxury car I had selected from their inventory, it defaulted to their standard luxury vehicle, which they erroneously have coded as a freaking pickup. Pretty sure nobody I could tell would be able to fix that."
"Interesting sidenote, which may explain some of this @avis mess. If you go to their website and click the Luxury Car Rentals link at the bottom, what pops up is a pickup ( https://t.co/j5yUUPhuFu). Apparently they have pickups coded as luxury vehicles in their system."
@kitchenmage @Avis Apparently nobody has the jag! But to swap it for a pickup???
"Well, we're not getting a Jaguar because he can't pick that option,. We're getting a BMW or an Audi and it's $70 less, but the same number of points. I gotta say I'm a little bummed about the Jag because that sounded like fun!"
This guy is being helpful. But their system shows no changes were ever made to the reservation. So he's trying to figure out what vehicle class the original was so he can try to fix it.
"Hmmmm. WHen I click the button in the app to call for reservations, the message says ""than you for calling the mobile app assist desk""."
Now I'm going to try calling. I'm sure this is going to go great ....
"He can't try to switch it to the right vehicle since I reserved it using points. Points reservations ""can't be modified in any way"", which is clearly not true side somebody changed it from a Jaguar to a pickup."
He says all I can do is cancel my reservation and try my luck again.
Roberto says he can't help me. He can't answer any of my questions and he recommends I call customer service. WTF is live chat customer service even for if they can't do anything @Avis ?
This time Roberto is going to help me. And his first question is to ask what I need. Which I literally typed already.
"An agent accepted, I got the message they would be happy to assist me, then they disconnected. Trying again."
Waiting . . .
Ohhhh. They have live chat support on their website. I have clicked the button..
So for Christmas I used my @Avis points to rent a spiffy little Jaguar in Florida. I just logged into my account to look at something and discovered they changed my reservation to a mid-size pickup. How the hell does that even happen??? #fail #tryharder  https://t.co/8a6jyJEcb1
@united They moved us to another gate and we got on the plane that was supposed to go to Houston. The Houston people were moved to our old gate to wait for a plane . . .

@united They're waiting for our plane to get clearance to taxi over from the hanger. Then they have to prep it. Same story as the flight that got me here.
And now it's time for my connecting @united flight to board. Not only is there no plane but the previously boarded plane is still at the gate.
"Turns out the plane was here. Has been for several hours. But apparently never got cleaned, do they're doing that now . . ."

"This is so great! We talk about using games to teach preparedness, but we don't do it enough. No excuses now! #iaem18"
@IDICworld That's one I won't be an early adopter of. Don't want to end up like Captain Archer's prized beagle.
I was surprised to find out that one of my neighbor EMs passed away earlier this year. #IAEM18  https://t.co/1LBfrhl40X
Pretty good turnout for this morning's @iaem USA business meeting. Starting off with our annual memorial service. #IAEM18  https://t.co/1K1uLhCjsP
@thejodyhodge The sadder thing for me was the why: costs of medical bills
Interesting observation: speaker asked if there were people in the room who weren't yet born when Columbine happened. Hands went up. Much of what we consider part of our shared EM experience isn't. #IAEM18
"This may be my fav takeaway from #IAEM18: Lord, grant me the serenity to accept stupid people the way they are, Courage to maintain my self-control, and Wisdom to know that if I act on it, I will go to jail."
"Great comments this morning about the importance of getting proper mental healthcare for yourself. Counseling is necessary, not a weakness. #IAEM18"
Huge shout-out to @chayne_s (in the photo) and @EOC_Designer from the @IAEMETC for stepping up to the challenge of recording all the #IAEM18 main sessions when the usual guy got deployed! Huge workload they weren't planning on!  https://t.co/2otseBtRVr

"I know we don't have control over this, but whatever the scent is they pump into the air at the @AmwayGrandPlaza is killing me. I start wheezing within 10 minutes of being in the building. #IAEM18"

I think that was one of the largest on-site @IAEMETC meetings we've ever had! Good send-off for my last meeting as Chair. #IAEM18  https://t.co/W00EaJQ5aj
So excited that so many of our @GeorgetownEDM students and grades are at #IAEM18. Nice showing!
From audience: machine learning and artificial intelligence are exploding. Some even explains why it made its decision. #iaem18
"Safety requires that we engage, not only with our local, state, and federal elected officials, but with the tech makers as well. They all need to hear from emergency managers. #iaem18"
Using all the technologies together in a coordinated reduces milling time since people hear the same info from multiple sources simultaneously. #iaem18
Question: how do we ensure companies are building safety into their tech products? #iaem18
Audience question: warning systems require education and training. Need appropriate response from those who receive them. #iaem18
Anything we do with technology is going to both fail and succeed initially. The goal is more successes than failures. #iaem18
Earthquake early warning could also provide automated tsunami warning for those who live close to coast. #iaem18
"Possibility for earthquake early warning: open fire bay doors, self-driving fire engine moves itself out to safety while firefighters are doing ""drop, cover, hold"". #iaem18"
"Data and automation can push info to your phone when you enter a new area, such as a tsunami zone. Could include evac info. Can also go the other way and tell EM how many people are in the evac area and where they are. #iaem18"
"As @schuback is talking about home automation and devices, I'm watching a squirrel on my front porch via my camera that has automated notifications. #iaem18"
"The majority of our emergency operations should not be using paper anymore. Most of what we do can use databases, electronic forms. #iaem18"
Home automation devices have the ability to tell us now if our homes have power and internet. We can check remotely. #iaem18
@schuback says we've eliminated fax machines. If only that were actually true . . . #iaem18  https://t.co/HKXIRg6wDD
Earthquake early warning allows us to use automation to protect things. What if a connected vehicle could move itself out of harm's way prior to the earthquake? #iaem18
"Earthquake early warning is rolling out, but requires more education and training to be successful. #iaem18"
Autonomous vehicles create an attractive target for criminal hackers. We have to be prepared for that. Cybersecurity is critically needed. #iaem18
Uncomfortable laughter in the room when @mdeyerin asks how many organizations in the room have ended up with technology bought by somebody who fundamentally didn't understand it. #iaem18
Autonomous vehicles will bring with them tremendous data. Are we prepared for that? Do we have the knowledge and skills to use it? #iaem18
"Autonomous vehicles have the ability to create a hyper-effecient system for daily use, but it will have difficulty accounting for surge from unplanned events (like disasters). #iaem18"
Autonomous vehicles will dramatically change society. Broad adoption will fundamentally change how our world works. #iaem18
"Augmented reality can be particularly useful in recovery, where it can overlay what used to be there with what's there now. #iaem18"
Augmented reality has great uses in EM. Drone footage with road and other data overlaid. #iaem18
5G requires massive investment in infrastructure. #iaem18
Autonomous vehicle tech will require 5G and meshed networks to be effective and widely used. They need to talk to each other among other things. #iaem18
"Autonomous vehicles require extensive sensors. Those sensors have to stay clean to work. Can be challenging in a disaster environment. How about ash, fog, heavy snow, or unexpected road closures? #iaem18"
Logistical needs may be met in the future via autonomous vehicles. Imagine your disaster supplies not having to stop for a sleep break on their way. Or the SNS rolling out on its own as soon as it's needed. #iaem18
Driverless cars can provide greater autonomy for people with access and functional needs. #iaem18 #iaemetc
Important idea: mapping alternative fuel sites. Critical need for people evacuating in electric cars. #iaemetc #IAEM18
Some of my favorite people! #iaem18

@Jdlazo What's significant to me if that whoever signed the contract clearly didn't understand the use case. Could Verizon have handled it differently? Sure. Could whoever was in charge of ordering the service have gotten the right plan to begin with? Definitely.

"@0xNBE1 Also, in general, communicating tech info to a non-tech audience is fraught with peril. It's easy to talk over the level of the audience OR treat them like they're stupid. Finding the sweet spot in the middle can be hard, especially for someone who isn't a trained communicator"

@BlairBraverman @creynoldsnc Why is it always a guy with a tractor??
@NASSorg I get the impression you've not actually visited local governments to see their practices. These are the same places that get cryptolockered because they can't get people to quit clicking on stupid shit.
And now we're officially later than our original flight. Luckily it's only going to make me late for a party.
@Responder_News Nice
Finally at LAS and we're going to have a 15 minute wait for a gate. So we're arriving at the same time we would have for our cancelled flight.
Well that's annoying. @twitter now requires that you give them a name of who is being impersonated when you report an account for that. That's how I've been reporting bots. I just wrote in that it was a bot impersonating a human.
"So it turns out my reservation home wasn't cancelled, but because I got upgraded and hubby didn't, they split me off into a new reservation. Which means of course that since I don't have a companion anymore, my companion can't be upgraded. To this, I say meh."
"@Responder_News @AlaskaAir Yeah, I hit the ""everything that can go wrong did"" day. I guess it's fair since things usually go so well!"
"Ohhhhhh. This is not good. Somehow, even though I'm on this plane, @AlaskaAir dropped me from the reservation and seems to have cancelled my return flight. We've got a few days to sort this out, but it can't be good."
Last minute upgrade. Gave it to hubby.
"@ehansford Yeah, all kinds of weird stuff. Good luck!"
"Me: hey, there's a helicopter hovering right there [at the airport]. That's wierd. Gate agent: not really. It's been an ""interesting"" day."

"Cancelled flight, now a delay. And this flight is oversold due to the cancelled one. Bad travel day for @AlaskaAir. #iFlyAlaska anyway because they deal with this stuff with kindness."
@poplifegirl And it turns out I DO have something for you. Hubby grabbed everything in the vicinity and the item was in the pile!
"@AlaskaAir Not an issue today since this flight is packed, but it's been over a year!"
"@mikamckinnon I've had this argument. I think I once said ""quit being an ass and let me opt out""."
"After all the chaos of my cancelled flight and hubby having to bring all my stuff to the airport, looks like the only thing I'm missing is my Surface case, which has my Surface pen and favorite thumbdrive in it. Not bad at all."
Hey @AlaskaAir I see you still have the bug in your system where my companion doesn't get added to the upgrade list. Any ETA to fix that?

Wonder if it comes with a company car . . .  https://t.co/CG4KyUtyt3
@elkentaro I was thinking maybe I should start one. But then I remembered what happened to every blog I ever started. One and done . . .
@pptsapper I was at the Udvar Hazy museum one day. Old duffer plopped down on the bench next to me to wait for his grandkids. Turns out he was a retired Marine aviator who was there to visit HIS plane and show it to his grandkids. Those were a few very cool minutes.
@PierceSheriff I'll just point out that @TroyMI_Police is doing a great job with the feel goods this week. Take a browse and I guarantee you'll feel a little less stress!
@Marriott That's a much more useful explanation! Thank you.
@chayne_s WTAF??
@McSev @Sieve70 Looks like Kron is back.
@Marriott That doesn't even pretend to answer my question.
@disasterstudent Nope.

"Someone just sent me, via e-mail, their username and password to an account. And their password is their first name and year of birth. I feel like my entire life has been a waste right now ...."
I can't imagine why anybody would ever fly on @united at this point.
@cxi @Marriott @HiltonHotels I had that thought as well. It was pretty glaring at the Hawaii property (with the reference to guys). The most recent one was resolved by my retired male Marine Drill Sergeant traveling companion. So yeah . . .
"@cxi @Marriott Multiple properties. And I just thought to read the rate rules again and they've changed. Guess I can always transfer my status to @HiltonHotels, but I'd rather not."
"@cxi @Marriott In both cases, they relented, but said they wouldn't next time."
"@cxi @Marriott Last stay, yes. And told me since I didn't have a federal credit card, I wasn't eligible. Fistful of other IDs and a federal travel auth didn't matter. Last year, one of their properties told me fed rate was ""only for those guys who shoot people and stuff""."
"Hey @Marriott, noticed that you've started limiting your government rates to only feds. What about us state and local government required to travel at the same rate? No longer welcome?"
So sad that Stephen Hawking died. A truly great mind.

Drunk Russian very nearly fell over the back of my seat. At least he apologized.
"He also spilled his beer, but did not hurt anyone or anything."
Now drunk Russian is annoying. Started badgering polite lady as soon as her boyfriend left his seat. Kerfuffle behind box brought supervisors and cops to our area tho and he chilled a bit.
Turns out the Russian is pretty drunk. He's also full and trying to convince the girl next to him to eat the other half of his sandwich. She's being very polite. An leaning closer and closer to her boyfriend.
@Sieve70 Our usher retired. His name was Larry and we really liked him  He's now season ticket holder in our section. Our new usher is much younger and we look forward to many seasons with him!

"@Sieve70 Funny thing. When he first got here, I thought maybe he was a misplaced soccer fan. Talking to himself. Then I figured out he had a buddy behind him, who he was talking to, in another actual language."
@Sieve70 We're probably a little tame by comparison.
"Russian guy is pretty funny. Clearly had no idea WTF we're all doing with our clapping and chanting and whatnot, but he's got his own. Which is mostly yelling AYE."

"@AmazonHelp It's your carrier, AMZL US."
@mdeyerin Interesting. They turned down the EMAT.
@AmazonHelp Done. Again. This is not the first time. You really need to allow delivery instructions like the real carriers do.
"@AmazonHelp You misunderstand. I'm reporting it to you. And it's your direct delivery service. Your even put a photo of my blocked screen door in my account. This happens all the time with your drivers. The major carriers all allow, and follow, delivery instructions."
@AmazonHelp I just did. What would you advise? I would advise you to train your drivers in basic physics. Heavy object against outward opening door = door not opening.
@paulbux @usahockey @WHLsilvertips @SeattleTbirds Yes!!

"Apparently we have a small piece of driftwood stuck in one of the jets. Forcing it out with the engines didn't work, so we're basically idling across the Straight of Juan de Fuca right now while an engineer manually removes the stick. This makes for much side to side roll!"

@VicBlanshard @victoriaroyals I don't like being cursed at on the street. Which is what I guess the Victoria fans think is cool. Whatever makes you happy though I guess.
"""help yourself to the free basket of meclizine"""
It's gonna be bumpy. Horizontal rain outside.
My unexpected takeaway from going to the @victoriaroyals games this weekend: local dub fans are not nearly as nice and welcoming as they used to be. #SadDay
@really_7 @ShaunanKruse Not sour grapes. I think it's great the Royals set a franchise record home win streak. I think it sucks that they had those icing calls against them that clearly weren't. And I think a goaltender beating a guy with his blocker should sit out the rest of the game.
@really_7 @ShaunanKruse Hahahaha! That's funny right there.
"@really_7 @ShaunanKruse Should ""have""."
@ShaunanKruse The officiating was some of the worst I've seen. And it went both ways. That particular one cost us a shot at winning though.
"@TBirdTidbits @AndyEide @ianhenry72 Interestingly, Vic's backup goaltender thought Outhouse was going to get tossed. He was out of his folding chair (yes, really, folding chair) and starting to warm up in the walkway behind the bench. He was genuinely surprised to have to set his chair back up and sit down."
"@brindisi ✋ they crash into us after they're done with Alaska. We've always sort of resented the fact that we have hurricane force winds, but don't get to call them hurricanes."

Outhouse pretty much just lost his mind right there. #VICvsSEA

"@CrisisFocus @IAEMETC The ransomers also target healthcare because of the lax hygiene practices. Makes it easier to get. But again, that's the bad guy, not the ransomware itself."
@IAEMETC Interesting fact: most cyber ransomers are never caught. Mostly because incidents are never reported. #IAEM17
@IAEMETC Ransomware is equal opportunity: it doesn't discriminate between targets. #IAEM17
"@IAEMETC Have an attack response plan: isolate infected device, secure backup data, activate incident response team. #IAEM17"

@IAEMETC Security Onion is a free intrusion detection system you can install to help you monitor what's going on in your network. #IAEM17

@IAEMETC Best method for ransomware prevention: good digital hygiene. Want help with this? Visit the Crisis Technology Center in booth 711. #IAEM17
"@IAEMETC Key point: even if you pay the ransom, you may not get your data back. #IAEM17"
"@IAEMETC Many solutions to prevent ransomware are not difficult to implement, but you have to actually do it. #IAEM17"
"@IAEMETC @eTechOps Best practice: never open email attachments without confirming with the sender that the attachment is legit. And don't confirm via email, use the phone or text to a known number, not the one in the email. #IAEM17"
@IAEMETC @eTechOps Large number of ransomware delivered via spam or malicious web links. Traditional antivirus software largely ineffective. #IAEM17
@IAEMETC @eTechOps Hundreds of ransomware variants. Some even have chat built in to help you communicate with the ransomer. #IAEM17
"@IAEMETC @eTechOps Most ransomware payments are made in crypto currency, which is often reinvested in further attacks. #IAEM17"
@IAEMETC @eTechOps $325 million paid last year to unlock ransomware. Average is $400-500 per unlock. Many people don't pay and either restore from backup or start over. #IAEM17

@ctownsenduk @bbdd333 @Jdlazo Indeed. That was more or less my comment that started this thread.
"@bbdd333 @ctownsenduk @Jdlazo Even if nothing else, it could eliminate clear duplicates. There's some great potential there to both speed things up and reduce noise."

And the second beer waterfall of the night has run under me. Seriously people. Hold your beer or get a sippy cup.
That was the biggest officiating goat rope I've ever seen. On and off ice. @TheWHL you really need to fix this.

@Morales4SDMayor I claimed specially that the 5 I'm affiliated with placed no such limits in their contacts. 5 is not the same as all.
"@Morales4SDMayor I made no such statement. I asked for evidence that they are placing limits, as it's very concerning to me and I want to know which ones."
@Morales4SDMayor I can say with certainty that none of my contracts contain such a limitation. I'm not attacking. I'm asking for evidence of your claim.
@Morales4SDMayor Policies are rarely posted in the public domain. They're on intranets and in employee manuals. Which is why search waits until tomorrow.
@Morales4SDMayor And yet you've claimed multiple times today that the limits are on place. Now you're saying you have no evidence to back that.
@Morales4SDMayor I'll have to look tomorrow to see which are publicly available. Please post links to contacts that limit/prohibit free speech.
@Morales4SDMayor No. I have copies of university policies that encourage free speech. I'm not minimizing. I asked a legit question that you didn't answer.

@Responder_News Great. Now I'm following another cat on Twitter!
About to kick off our presentation on #drones and social at #GSMCon2017 with @MaryJoFly. Prepare to be nerded.
"@AlaskaAir 660. Just came up delayed, but I already knew! Watched the inbound arrive. Comfy seat. Plenty of drinks. #itsallgood"
"@RealmofHelm It comes with a warning pinned at the top, since prior are likely to be confused by the lack of theme!"
This is handy. My seat at the @AlaskaAir lounge has a direct view of my gate. I can say with certainty that we're not boarding in time.
@RealmofHelm I do. I call it Twitter.
Apparently the hubby decided the easiest way to remove the giant old TV from the attic was in pieces. #nerdlife  https://t.co/69I2EyTtqu
"Yeesh. @SeaTacAirport is a zoo tonight. Heavy traffic, much construction, closed checkpoints, people everywhere."
@bronleamishler Are you still going to be there tomorrow night?
"I love that @SeattleTbirds have 18 guys on the scoresheet in the playoffs already, and it includes the goaltender! #letsgobirds #winthecup"
@bronleamishler @RodeoGoatDallas Uhhhhhhhhhh
"@Bladesvoice Most of us ARE NHL fans. They just won't give us a team in the modern era. We did win the Stanley Cup in 1917, so we've got 100 years of exp"
@Jdlazo @HolyMolySoelle Maybe you can convince @WxKyleNelson to go next year!
@MaryJoFly Problem is that all sorts of malicious things can lurk behind a QR code. #GSMCon2017
@Jdlazo @MaryJoFly This is why I love my friends. #coffeescouts
Fly all night tonite. Arrive DFW at 0500. Acquire coffee. Speak on drones and social at 0915 for #GSMCon2017 w/@MaryJoFly. #longday #funday
@RealmofHelm Yes!

@garytx When did that guy turn into such a jerk??
"Looking forward to meeting everybody at #GSMCon2017 on Thursday, when @MaryJoFly and I talk #drones and Social Media."
@ericaberry2001 I'll take a look at that. I hate it when they roll out new features and don't say anything ...
"@shwood @CharlieFrid I taught a class once (week long) where a guy in the class wore a hat that said ""that guy"". It was so, so fitting!"
@ericaberry2001 negative
"The new Twitter mobile ""feature"" of not being able to remove someone from a convo is annoying."
"@McSev @united More wierd: 1) cop was wearing jeans. 2) guy got back on the plane. Guessing more to story, but not much could justify that use of force."
"@McSev @united Yep. Mult eyewitness pics and vids, including close-ups of the blood. And United has acknowledged it, with a note about re-accommodation."
This. Another reminder of why I'll never fly @united. All because they screwed up and let too many paying customers on the plane?  https://t.co/LxWuFFNxuK

"Was that song ""I like is better when we're wasted"" at a youth hockey game???"
@NucksNBirds Never once had one spilled on me there when I had season tix.
@NucksNBirds I got more beer spilled on me when we were Everett season tix holders than everywhere else we've been combined.
"Ok @SeattleTbirds fans. Next period, we troll Hart. #letsgobirds"
I'm gonna lose my voice.
"Ok, I'm going to give a little credit for ""can't keep my hands to myself"" to accompany the holding call. #thatsfunnyrightthere"

Also realizing how lucky we are to have @RealmofHelm behind the mic and the tunes at @ShoWareCenter.
@ShaunanKruse He's slightly to my right. Agree.
Pretty sure the actual biggest group of the night in Everett is @SeattleTbirds fans. #letsgobirds

It's been a long time since I sat in a middle seat between two strangers. I don't like it. Only doing it to get home 3+ hours sooner.
I guess this flight is going to be spent engrossed in my @coursera data science math skills class.
@WingzTeam And I can send you an email when I'm not crammed between two giant dudes on a plane.
"@WingzTeam Non responsive buttons. Tried to modify, couldn't choose my destination. Cancelled it. Tried to book new. ""Let's go"" button wouldn't click."

@AlaskaAir Hrmm. None of that sounds like what they said they served!
Just realized that my Logitech webcam was top of the line in 2007. It has a whopping 2 MP camera. Might be time to upgrade.
@AlaskaAir easy question of the night. What was that awesome beer they served on BOI-&gt;SEA tonight??

Two recent @AlaskaAir flights with flight attendant trainees on-board. You wouldn't know though except for their nametags and watchful eyes.

And now I'm starving.

@chiefb2 Unless it was Butte County Sheriff. He did say in presser that it was the hardest decision he's ever made.

@Tarantino4me Yep.
"@Tarantino4me It is a best practice. But I don't often see agencies saying ""here's our recommended list of accounts to get official info"""
@Tarantino4me I'm thinking specifically lists of official sources (the same ones that EMs would use). And giving that list to the public.
"@Tarantino4me but it's not easier for the public. It's easy for us, but how does the public get the info they need in realtime?"
@Jdlazo @JimAleski @Tarantino4me @IAEMETC Maybe one solution is for agencies to create lists and share those with public. #smem
@Jdlazo @SamLMontano the sheer volume of political posts has gotten overwhelming. That's going to spill into everything. #smem
@Jdlazo Your comments from that incident were part of our conversation! :)
"@bbdd333 @Jdlazo @Tarantino4me and can be difficult to setup on the fly during a crisis, from a mobile device, while trying to evac! #smem"
"@SamLMontano @Jdlazo in reality, all disasters are human-made. If it weren't for the humans, there would be no disasters. chicken and egg."
@Jdlazo @Tarantino4me makes a good case for AI and machine learning. #smem
@Jdlazo I was talking about that last night with @Tarantino4me. We're going to have to come up with some algorithms to filter the ick out.
@911disbitch For a moment I thought that was a bottle of vodka ...

And of course now I'm hungry.
"And now ""we're boarding by group"", but they just also said everybody who had previously checked in. So everybody went."
And apparently that line was not for boarding. It was for making sure we had a pass.
"@McSev small plane, so hopefully my backpack fits under the seat"
"Yep, new drama. Instead of calling groups, they just did an all call. So now I'm at almost the end of the line instead of Priority. #dumb"
"New plane, new gate, busted escalator to get to it. And now passengers being dumb. I sense this drama is not yet over."
@McSev sitting in ORD. Headed for Cincinnati. Eventually. I hope.
"Annnnnd, I just looked out the window as our original plane rolled away from the gate. Hopefully @AmericanAir is getting us a new one."
Sigh. @AmericanAir just popped up a 10 minute delay for our flight. Says it now leaves 2 minutes from now. #NotHappening
"And now we're back in the terminal, waiting to see if @AmericanAir can fix the plane or if they have to find us a new one. #FlightDelay"
Thankfully it's not freezing outside.
Grumpy gate agent just went down to the plane. Grumpy because he has half the plane checked in and now has to undo that. And still we wait.
"Walking down boarding ramp. Mechanical delay. Everybody turned around, but now we're stuck on the ramp and can't get back in the terminal."

@Quicken which is not useful when I'm driving. Still have to use a secondary program. How about including it in P&amp;L which it doesn't in 2016

@Alisha_Beth @brittnich360 exactly! It's obvious people aren't paying attention to the call. @CJSatter and I had this rant yesterday to!

Interesting thing last night was that the crowd ID'd the person of interest as not a suspect before he even saw himself listed. #smemchat
My point is that most agencies are barely equipped to understand and use non-streaming SM. How do we equip them for this? #smemchat
@TheFireTracker2 you misunderstand. I'm not seeking control. I'm seeking best practices for how we use it. #smemchat
"@Tarantino4me and arguable, the public probably doesn't really care. #smemchat"

@Motley_Su @zillahockeyclub Final 50/50 take was $12K.
"@ihackedwhat @defcon Well, Jane Fonda seems to be AWOL. I did find Reebok aerobics though. Funny the ones I saw and thought ""No, gotta keep"""
@zillahockeyclub @Motley_Su Was that the bow jersey??? I now have no guilt about you giving me the magnet for nothing. :P
@zillahockeyclub @Motley_Su I've been to NHL games in Canada where the pot was $40K. They LOVE their 50/50 up there.
@ihackedwhat @defcon blank ones or used ones? Pretty sure I have a Jane Fonda Yoga tape I could donate to the cause ....
"@zillahockeyclub They took it off the screen, but the pot was about $20k (which the winner gets half of)."
I hope all the @SeattleTbirds fans at the @Kelowna_Rockets game are buying 50/50 tickets. Holy cow that'a a HUGE jackpot.
@Motley_Su We paid for the video feed of the @SeattleTBirds @Kelowna_Rockets game. Nice to listen to @Reganrant. #letsgobirds

"@Jdlazo Intel? In the EOC I've only used it in plans, but would have moved that if it were criminal incident. #smemchat"
"@Jdlazo Intel fits in many places in the org chart. Command staff, general staff, unit leader, branch chief. Whatever works.  #smemchat"
"@schuback @rusnivek I might have created confusion with this. I was referring to the SM function in the EOC, not in the ICP. #smemchat"
@Jdlazo which situation? #smemchat
"@schuback @rusnivek but if other sections report to EOC Manager, this would too if it were it's own section."
@redcrossmom We're specifically addressing the NIMS refresh and the integration of SMEM into it. #smemchat
Thanks for joining us today @find_doc! #smemchat
I liked the flexibility of the Intel branch/SME/Unit/staff position in current NIMS. I view #SMEM in similar fashion. #smemchat
@eTechOps Those of us in small shops use it for both though. Not enough space or staff to split it. #smemchat
"@Responder_News No extra layer, as teams talk directly to each other. #smemchat"
"@find_doc @BeniciaBERT Oops! Question of ""how"" more important than ""who"". #smemchat"
"@rusnivek @find_doc @Jdlazo I think it depends on the size and structure of the EOC. Worked for me, but not in other places. #smemchat"
"@BeniciaBERT @find_doc The question of ""who"" is more important that the question of ""who"". #smemchat"
@find_doc @Jdlazo When I ran EOC the #SMEM team was separate and physically sat between PIO &amp; SA teams. Lead reported to EOC Mngr. #smemchat
"@find_doc Absolutely! Perfect world: #SMEM integrated into existing plans, ready for implementation. #smemchat"
"@find_doc @eTechOps People get things tho without understanding the process. I can throw a #SMEM job aid to a sewer guy, but ... #smemchat"
@find_doc Kind of like we have a lead PIO and a team. Somebody needs to be an SME. #smemchat
@find_doc Example: was called in as advisor in realtime to tell and EOC WTF they needed. They we found resources to support. #smemchat
"@eTechOps @find_doc So one useful tool would be ""how to do a #SMEM needs analysis"" for a jurisdiction. #smemchat"
"@eTechOps @find_doc One of the biggest problems is that tools are purchased based on ""cool"" not a needs analysis and biz case. #smemchat"
@find_doc One of the things typically missing is an SME/key advisor who can help agency figure out their needs. #smemchat
"@eTechOps I know, and we often lump them together in many ways. #smemchat"
"You're talking about having an #SMEM pool, not just one person, right? #SMEMChat   https://t.co/kE8kkLVxWM"
"@schuback it's also #OSINT though, which is different than communications. #smemchat"
@find_doc @BeniciaBERT and our view is limited somewhat by how #SMEM works today. The future will bring new and different uses. #smemchat
@find_doc @BeniciaBERT One of the keys is that it has to remain flexible. It will depend on the function its service. #smemchat
Good morning early #smemchat!

@Unlimitedville I have a @yourKarma that I love! It's my secondary though since I already pay for some data on my phone.
Want a little #motivation for the day? Check out this video:  https://t.co/7wCT9mymT1 We show it to every FEMA Natl Advanced Academy class
@triecker I've been with @TMobile since they were VoiceStream (except for a 1 year break). This is ridiculous though.
@TMobileHelp no one has answered my questions. All them are still in play. Most important one though is why my 7 gig plan got capped at 5.
@TMobileHelp just read any or all of the 15 previous DMs. No need for me to send yet another.
@TMobileHelp how about you read any of the previous 15 DMs first.
At least the @tmobile app works this morning. I can see how much tethered data I'm using. I'm supposed to have 7 gigs. They capped me at 5.
Ugh. Woke up to msg from @tmobile saying I can't look up my tethered data user because I have a biz plan. I don't have a biz plan. #fail
@TMobileHelp what is one more DM going to do that the previous 10 haven't?  Check history before telling me to do what I've already done.
"Hour and a half later, @tmobile giving me the silent treatment and still no answer. Sleep now. Escalate tomorrow.  https://t.co/iNX2g249f1"
Pretty sure I used the last of my @tmobile tethered data trying to figure out how much data I'd used. #headdesk #grumpy
@triecker @TMobile @TMobileHelp omg. Made me change my password because that was magically going to make their app work. It didn't. #fail
It's been an hour now @tmobile. All I want to know is how to find my tethered data usage.  https://t.co/DeiS4VnWjA
So @tmobile does not allow you to view your tethered data usage via their web portal. Must use app. Which requires mystery pwd change. #fail
"Tick, tock, tick, tock @TMobile. It's a pretty simple question. Where do I find my tethered data usage?  https://t.co/DeiS4VnWjA"
Had to use the tertiary in Alaska. Unlocked mifi that I can put any SIM. I carry a pay-as-you-go AT&amp;T SIM and a global one from elsewhere.
@TMobileHelp I guess. But how hard can it be to just tell me where to look t up?
"@TMobile how do I figure out my current tethered data usage? Got the 80% warning, but can't find what current usage is."
And today I learned that unlimited data on @TMobile does not mean unlimited hotspot data. Good thing I have a secondary mifi. And tertiary.

"ShelterBox vols expected to be boots-on-the-ground within 48 hours of getting ""the call"". #iaem15"
"ShelterBox deploys in 2-person teams, with the intent of rapidly distributing tents to those who need them. #iaem15"
"After 4 days in outdoor training, those who make it through ShelterBox initial training go to England for 2 weeks for more training. #iaem15"
"Anybody can be a nice person for 24 hours. After that, true nature tends to emerge. Some nice, some not so much. #iaem15"
ShelterBox training is very intense and designed to induce stress. #iaem15
"ShelterBox Response team members are Logisticians, Case Workers, Diplomats, and Ambassadors.  #iaem15"
ShelterBox has two kinds of volunteers: Ambassadors and Response Team members. #iaem15
"40 ShelterBox employees in GB, 4 in US. Everybody else is volunteer. #iaem15"
Next really big ShelterBox response was 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Deployed twice as many shelters as ever before. #iaem15
First big ShelterBox response was the 2001 earthquake. #iaem15
"ShelterBox is a British charity, but has 20 affiliate countries, incorporated in those countries for PR and fundraising, #iaem15"
"ShelterBox ""box"" includes a tent and essential supplies for survival, including stove, kitchen items, and water purification system. #iaem15"
ShelterBox was founded by a @Rotary club in Great Britain in 2000. #iaem15
@RaquelLackey don't forget: Booth 603!
Getting ready to watch @disaster_dave talk about @shelterboxus at #iaem15.
"Pickles is the poster dog for @HopeAACR. If somebody says ""Do you want Pickles?"" in your disaster, think of her, not the food! #iaem15"
"@kerryshearer Hey, if you're at #iaem15, you should come over to the CTC in Booth 603 and chat! Always looking for new #iametc members."
"Trauma tourists will also show up at your scene. Check credentials, go through proper channels to get legit people and dogs. #iaem15"
"""therapy ducks"" and a ""therapy pig"" showed up at recent scenes. Not really trained for the job! #iaem15"
"Like other legit teams, qualified crisis response dog teams don't just show up. They come when they're called. #iaem15"
Be sure to research qualified crisis dog teams BEFORE you need them. Legit ones will come with their own insurance. #iaem15
"Crisis therapy dogs are not always an appropriate asset. Wildfires for instance create unhealthy working environments for them, #iaem15"
I always find it slightly disconcerting to listen to somebody talk about a disaster I responded to. Not in a bad way tho. #iaem15
"The better your relationship with a dog, the more relaxed your interaction with it will be. #iaem15"
Some jerk is copying my tweets and passing them off as their own. #GetYourOwnTweets
"HOPE Animal Assisted Crisis Response (@HopeAACR) can be called at any time, by any agency, at no charge. #iaem15"
Crisis therapy dog teams work much shorter shifts than humans in disasters. Usually max of 4 hours. #iaem15
"Dogs must be trained before being deployed. Must be trained and registered as a therapy team, then extra quals for crisis response. #iaem15"
Interactions with animals: our heart rate and blood pressure drop. Makes us less anxious. Helps us focus on the present. #iaem15
Service dog is focused on the ONE they serve. Crisis dog focuses on everybody. #iaem15
"Emotional phases of disaster: Pre-disaster, Impact, Heroic, Honeymoon, Disillusionment, Reconstruction. #iaem15"
"some research shows that the longer we're on shift, the more likely we are to think we can just keep going. #iaem15"
Disaster stress can lead to impaired judgement and poor decision making. Can also cause compassion fatigue. #iaem15
Crisis stress management activities were activated withing just a few hours of the SR530 landslide happening. Critical element.  #iaem15
"Q: how do you know you're stressed? A: I use ""different"" words. *laughter* #iaem15"
The mere presence of a crisis response dog can break down barriers and get people talking. #iaem15
"Crisis response dogs require training at both ends of the leash, mostly the human end. Dogs are already trained as therapy dogs. #iaem15"
"Do you know the difference between a service dog, a therapy dog, and a crisis response dog? #iaem15"

@Plan_Prep_Live I could tweet all day in my city and hardly anybody would see it. I get great engagement on FB posts tho.
@Plan_Prep_Live it really comes down to the comms plan a local agency has made and the research they've done on their audience.
@Plan_Prep_Live Your original post said EMs were going to quit using FB for breaking news. Different discussion than prep.
"@Plan_Prep_Live Agreed, but preparedness is different than breaking news and requires different tactics."

"Big thanks to @FEMARegion10 , @hhsgov, @polaris_project for today’s webinar. Katherine Chon is a great speaker on human trafficking."
How to prevent human trafficking during disasters? Identify at-risk populations. Outreach to at-risk pops. Educate responders.
Japan earthquake/tsunami: homeless people recruited. Not fed/sheltered properly. Exposed to high radiation levels.
Haiti Earthquake: children exchanging sex for food and other basic needs.
Hurricane Katrina: domestic violence and sex assault in shelters. Pvt agencies trafficked labor workers from Thailand and other places.
"2004 tsunami: increased reports of sexual violence and physical abuse, forced prostitution, abuse by aid workers."
Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 requires actions to limit trafficking post-disaster.
How do natural disasters increase vulnerability to human trafficking? Unequal access to opportunities and unequal exposures to risk.
Traffickers sometimes tattoo or brand their victims.
Lack of awareness by general public contributes to human trafficking issues.
"Lack of training for law enforcement, social services, healthcare workers contributes to victim inability to escape trafficking."
Some evidence shows LGBTQ youth are 5 times more likely to be victims of trafficking.
Trafficking victims are highly likely to encounter healthcare providers while being trafficked. 88% of domestic sex trafficking survivors.
Homeless and runaway youth are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.
California study showed up to 80% of child trafficking victims were already part of the child welfare system.
Traffickers are purposeful in their recruitment. Looking for people who are disconnected from their support systems.
@Clim8Resilient live tweeting webinar!
"Large proportion of sex trafficking victims are black, while labor trafficking victims are disproportionately Hispanic."
Majority of sex and labor trafficking victims are people of color.
@Clim8Resilient psych would fall under coercion.
"National trafficking hotline accepts calls, texts, emails. 95k+ reports last year."
Heat map of trafficking reports. Many in Region 10.  http://t.co/blLjzh7MRU
"Trafficking occurs in many places, often right in front of us. May even involve families or partners.  http://t.co/bTj2shGRKz"
"Trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purposes of commercial sex work, labor, or services."
Many myths around human trafficking. It can be foreign or domestic workers. Can involve sex work and labor work.
Thanks @FEMARegion10 for hosting this webinar on human trafficking and emergency preparedness. Great info! #EMLife #ModernDaySlavery

How do we address these future issues? Start the conversations. #piepc
"Ah, 2005, when everybody was getting command vehicles. Never got around to the command vehicle rodeo though! #piepc"
Audience comment: Baby boomers had a large middle class. Gen X has a shrinking middle-class. Millennials may have no middle-class. #piepc
@Alisha_Beth Another reason 1-person shops suck. No institutional knowledge to pass down.
Vastly entertaining discussion of generational stereotypes. #piepc
@oremergencymgr @ElizabethKingEM It's pretty awesome!
Gen X and Millenials often undervalue the historical perspective of baby boomers. #piepc
"Boomers are just as tech savvy, but they must see a value and benefit to learning it. Time more valuable to them. #piepc"
"""How many baby boomers in the room thinking 'I'm too hold for this sh*t""?. Much laughter. Thanks @Mdeyerin #piepc"
There's a biohacked person in the room. I'm super dissappointed by the eye rolling and sighing of a segment of the crowd. #piepc
@sct_r @oremergencymgr And some people forget that tech is more than comms!
@Mdeyerin are you sure you don't want to join @iaem Emerging Tech Caucus? We could use you! #iaemetc
"@oremergencymgr @sct_r My assumption is that we build out as much tech as possible, then use what survives or can be rebuilt quickly."
"@sct_r But much of tech will, either directly or indirectly. Last seesion talked about loss of ham radio due to pissing match."
We  (EM) hold a significant responsiblity for fixing society when tech breaks or has unintended consequences. #piepc
Deyerin: Need to consider both the positive and negative impacts of technology. #piepc
"@BothellPolice Hey, I recognize that room! Happy telecommunictions week!"
Advancements in technology are rapidly exceeding our ability to predict their impacts. #piepc
"Disruptive Tech:something that helps create a new market and value network, and in the process disrupts and existing market/network. #piepc"
"More disruptive tech: bitcoin, 3d printing, nanotech, electric vehicles. Many others. #piepc"
"Exciting tech mentioned: earthquake early warning, drones, Lidar, social media, simulations, Internet, virtual reality, robotics. #piepc"
Disruptive Technology: changes the landscape in exciting and challenging ways. #piepc
"De Pombal took advantage of the incident to improve building standards and convince people that ""acts of God"" can be controlled. #piepc"
"Quote: ""we bury the dead and care for the living"" came from Marques de Pombal in response to earthquake/tsunami/fire in Portugal. #piepc"
"Deyerin: How tech, economy, politics, generational shift are influencing rapid evolution in EM. #piepc"
@oremergencymgr @TheRedElm Indeed. I've known @MDeyerin since I started in EM in Washington. Always a good presenter! #piepc
Now up: @MDeyerin to talk about Future Shock! #piepc
Miller: EM is all about relationships. Need to have as many in advance as possible. #piepc
Miller: Resource ordering needs to have a process and you need to stick to it. #piepc
"Miller: ""who is in charge""needs to be worked out ahead of time. #piepc"
Miller: lack of command depth was an issue. #piepc
"@Jdlazo There are presentations for all of them. They may be for paying attendees only at this point, but I can get you a copy of this one."
"Miller: You order it, you pay for it. Have a good system in place for order resources. #piepc"
Miller: logistics of who gets what dontations is complex and needs to be planned for. #piepc
Miller: Hundreds of burned cattle became public health emergency. Able to remove from private property. #piepc
"Poor burned baby bear photos. Many ""ahhhs"" from the crowd. ""Cinder"" will be released back to the wild soon tho. #piepc"
"Miller: 90% of disaster donations will be junk. Used underwear, high heels, bags of rags not useful. #piepc"
"Big shout outs to Southern Baptists, Soup Ladies, and WSART from Miller for Carlton Complex fires. #piepc"
Miller: working with established volunteer groups will be a big help. They've been there and done that. #piepc
"Miller: people will show up to help. They need a task, food, bathrooms, etc. #piepc"
Mute your phone people! #piepc
Miller: train people how to treat others under pressure. #piepc
Miller: Abusive treatment is never justified. Collateral damage is never acceptable in the EM world. #piepc
Miller: Great leaders treat people with dignity and respect at all times. #piepc
@oremergencymgr Avg age of my team has probably dropped 20 years in the past 9. Very engaged group.
Miller: people handling is huge in an incident. Morale and stress are killers. #piepc
@oremergencymgr I think it's starting to shift back a bit though. Preppers and geeks are finding a great tool for various things.
"@oremergencymgr You might be shocked by ham radio though. I did a testing session last year for 300ish, avg age 30."
"@oremergencymgr It is a tool in the box though. In this case, it was a secondary or tertiary fallback. All else failed too."
"Miller: the ham radio system in this fire failed due to people programs, not equipment failures. Lost comms w/critical area. #piepc"
Miller: active rumor management is essential to response. Particularly on social media. #piepc
Miller: use all poss communications pathways. Neighbors/phone trees/EAS/ENS/Door-to-door/Radio/TV/Social Media/meetings/trap lines. #piepc
"Miller: People expect to be made whole after a disaster, but that is never realistic. #piepc"
"@NWTEMC_PNW Yep, but locals who pay into a seperate entity sometimes forget that they still have responsibility. #piepc"
Miller: Citizens have very high expectations of government that we often cannot meet. #piepc
Miller: Lots of people potentially in charge. Must define who does what in advance. #piepc
Miller: emergencies start and end locally. Local agencies must recognize their role and plan/train for it. #piepc
Miller: local cities must have a designated Emergency Manager and a plan. Need to function alone even when part of a shared entity. #piepc
Miller: your briefing rooms need conference call capability. Huddling around somebody's cell phone with the speaker on doesn't work. #piepc
Miller: you can't put everything in one room. Don't co-locate EOC/call center/lunch room/policy rooms. #piepc
Miller: Also needed a lot more people to rotated through EOC. Needed outside IMT team. #piepc
Miller: EOC in ops capacity required depth of ICS training (300 + 400) plus experience. Not enough people qualified. #piepc
"Miller: IMTs were focused on firefighting. EOC had an ops function, not just support. Evacs, water checks, feeding, all done by EOC. #piepc"
"Miller: The EOC takes on a much larger role in big disaster. It requires more people, stuff, and info than you ever imagined, #piepc"

@amvendetti yay!
@sarfoss Do you enjoy it? Looking for something to volunteer my time for.
"@bbdd333 @TheRedElm @sct_r sometimes I think @TweetDeck just gets clogged. I tend to leave mine open for days and then it gets cranky, :P"
"@LarzWaltz It was supposed to be, but mine was still struggling. So I bailed. :P"
@bbdd333 @TheRedElm @TweetDeck @sct_r It did yesterday. Close and reopen?
Do I have any friends who volunteer with @SBTaskForce?
Yay for @att pay as you go mi-fi today. I'm now able to tweet along with the rest of the class. #piepc

@askhangwith cool! Hopefully somebody will get back to me on my request for a speaker too. ;)
@donttrythis Yes. It's mostly just a boring hunk of metal at this point ...
@Night_ER_Ninja Shocking that he could claim anything at all! That's a pro for sure!
Today I learned that @hangwith is not a good option for #smem use. Limit is 15 minute broadcast unless you are @verified. Most of us aren't.
@FCCEmMgt So you know that #smemchat happens on Fridays at 12:30 PM EDT?
@Nats_Blog it's not a camera. And the speaker is remote. I moved it closer to her. Hopefully that will help.
Nice shout out to @EFF during the #IAEMETC cyber security presentation.

"@Alisha_Beth I can try that, but don't really want to expose my user info to the world. Will tinker on break."
First @hangwith limitation found. 15 minute broadcast limit for unverified users. #IAEMETC

@LarzWaltz so I take it the audio is ok??

@AnneWheaton It's an abandoned account. Twitter might help you take it over or have it closed.
@askhangwith Well then I'll quit looking for it! :)
@askhangwith But I'm using Chrome.
@askhangwith Interestingly now I've gotten some to work. I'll keep tinkering before we try to use it Sunday.
@askhangwith I've poked around and can't see any live streams from my computer using the links in Twitter.
"@askhangwith Also, vertical orientation only? No way to force horizontal?"
"@askhangwith What I'm saying is that some people can't view the stream. Me for instance. The screenshot is black with a white ""play"" arrow"
"@Jdlazo ok, I'm going to call that a success then."
w/scba21 #Live @hangwith  http://t.co/qz1N2x7bQm
@Jdlazo Did you view it live or the recording though?
@Jdlazo Problem is that not everybody can see it live for some reason. I can't go to another machine in my house and see it.
@Jdlazo He doesn't actually eat it. He just licks and chews on it. I figured it would make a good sound check!
"@askhangwith Well, it seems to broadcast, but I can't view it using any other devices. Any suggestions?"

@MsZenner That's what I got too on my PC. I wonder why some can see and some can't. Hmmmm. ....
"@Jdlazo No, I was being silent! :)"
please click and see if you can view the stream #smemchat  w/scba21  http://t.co/tf7D7Tw9zI
"@hangwith Yep, figured it out. it just didn't tweet the info the first time for some reason. Worked the second time."
"Ok, well test 2 with @hangwith worked more or less like I expected. Not sure what went wrong the first time."
test 2. w/scba21  http://t.co/u2WsLPOtyP
Hmmm. Appears that @hangwith requires people to follow each other in order to view broadcast. That's not going to work for #iaemetc

@yellowjkt We're going to have a presentation about live streaming during an upcoming #IAEMETC meeting. #smemchat
@densaer I have SM specific training for ham radio vols who want to do SM. Not all do both. SM is subset of team. #smemchat
"@oremergencymgr uh, no. :)"
Don't forget that @iaem is accepting #SMEM articles until the end of today for the upcoming Bulletin. #smemchat
A2: I monitor a list I created of local news agencies. #smemchat
@densaer Welcome home!
"@sextonjn @PatokaFire10a16 Exactly. Image is everything. Plus, people might look up those personal accounts as well. #smemchat"
"@PatokaFire10a16 I would never give a vol like that access to post on my behalf. Monitoring only, via their own accounts. #smemchat"
@PatokaFire10a16 One of the reasons I use the TweetDeck extension in Chrome is that my spell check works right. :) #smemchat
"@ChrissyHeflin You can also look at only the geotagged ones, that that will limit what you see. #smemchat"
@ChrissyHeflin That's where a tool like TwitterFall comes in handy. You can throttle the speed. #smemchat
@sweir93 I treat it same as I would our phone bank. We have an FAQ for an incident. Vols can give out the info via phone or #SM. #smemchat
"@ChrissyHeflin for starters, I exclude all retweets. Drastically reduces the number of things to sort through. #smemchat"
A1: I also use a small subset of volunteers to reply to questions using our official accounts. Highly trained tho. #smemchat
A1: I use my ham radio people to do #smem monitoring. No access to official accounts needed. #smemchat
@PatokaFire10a16 Don't assume your volunteers must have access to your accounts to help you though. #smemchat
Q1: How are you utilizing volunteers to support your #SMEM efforts? #smemchat
Good morning #SMEMCHAT. What shall we talk about today?
@Jdlazo @FCCEmMgt Indeed. Successful degrees programs need to incorporate internships for those not already employed.
"Yep, it's my day off. Duty officer phone won't stop honking ... #EMLife"

"@Tarantino4me if you get bored in Anniston and want go strolling through a graveyard, let me know. My g-grandparents are buried there."
Good chat people. Sorry I didn't have more than one question. :P  #backtoreality #smemchat
@sct_r  That's no excuse! Get a @Gogo  account. #SMEMCHAT from 30K feet.
@BeniciaBERT Not all served by agencies. That's why it's important to reach out and find out. #smemchat
"@BeniciaBERT We need to go to ""them"", not expect ""them"" to come to us. That's what accessibility is. #smemchat"
"@BeniciaBERT Important to reach out, see how they expect to receive info, then provide it that way. May not be an SM solution. #smemchat"
"@Jdlazo I think sometimes EMs hear ""OMG, more work. I can't do it all."" and get defensive instead of looking for easy solutions. #smemchat"
"@Jdlazo became clear yesterday that not all EM understand that. ""we have TDD and they can use 711"" was a limiting statement! #smemchat"
"@BeniciaBERT If nobody knows its there, or isn't using #SMEM, then it won't reach the audience you think it will. #smemchat"
"@BeniciaBERT They do, but only if an agency is using it and the community expects to find it. #smemchat"
"@Tarantino4me I would agree except yesterday. EM said ""deaf can do x to get our info"" and deaf person said ""give it to us direct, no hoops""."
I feel like #AltusOk is ganging up on #smemchat today. How many of you are there?? :)
@AltusEMLisa so opt in services as opposed to #SMEM then? #SMEMCHAT
@1TimHowson Well good afternoon then #NDPTC people from #SMEMCHAT. Which location?
"@Fyrechief Indeed, that's what prompted my musing. Seemed there were different expectations."
I'm just pondering whether there's a disconnect between what the deaf/hard of hearing expects and what EM thinks they expect. #smemchat
Q1.a: Have you reached out to local deaf/hard of hearing community to see what their expectations are? #smemchat
"Q1.a: For those efforting to reach the deaf/hard of hearing people, have you reached out to your local population to see what they expect?"
@1TimHowson Just thinking about that makes me cold.
Q1: How is your agency using #SMEM to engage the deaf and hard of hearing community? #smemchat
So quiet in #SMEMCHAT this morning!
Going to try to participate in #smemchat today.

"@MZennerBertels @BeniciaBERT It's still an objective or goal, not a task. Tasks are ""go put out that fire"" or ""go monitor twitter""."
@NWTEMC1 @MaryJoFly @EMgrB There were a few that touched on it in various ways. But nothing dedicated I don't think.
"@BeniciaBERT @PatokaFire10a16 The new TTT is fantastic, so I recommend taking it. But may or may not be required by your agency."

"@NWTEMC1 I say huge value. Great networking, great info. Many go on own dime. I have. #smemchat #iaem14"

"@RFxConnect @CherylBle @SSgtKRich @sarah water utilities, airports, cemeteries, golf courses, other enterprises. Must function w/o taxes."
@RFxConnect @CherylBle @SSgtKRich that's not really true. A lot of governments do run enterprises that are required to turn a profit.
@greymaiden @lacosteaef @kjatar @Arashinomoui runs the gamut!
@garytx gross! Isn't that one of their hubs even?
@greymaiden @lacosteaef @kjatar @Arashinomoui There's a real wine cellar at the Rio. A good one!
"@DougonIPComm if you're to old for #defcon, might as well crawl in your coffin now and call it quits!"

@ShadowM82 just follow the 3-2-1 rule and you'll be fine. #DEFCON

I'm appalled that @TOEFLGMATGRELSA believes they should not teach ESL students about homophones. How do you learn English without them??
@jonahweiland Only thing that could make is better is a little fresh salsa!

"@densaer ah. Crazy though. Not unexpected, but surely annoying!"
@suzboop @MaryJoFly @CaravanStudios You'll have to contact member services at info@iaem.com.
@densaer so some directed at your team and some directed at people viewing your content?
@densaer Interesting.
@densaer I saw you post that you were dealing with attacks while deployed. Were they DOS or other? Any similarities? Super curious.
@FoxRn1 Did you get it sorted out?
"@caravanstudios @MaryJoFly Ouch. SQL error. Borked database. If the refresh doesn't work, can e-mail member services."
@ButtersOK liked the food. Lost a little weight. Coupons expired about the time sample arrived tho. @HillsPet #ScienceDiet #PerfectWeight
@caravanstudios that one's outside my pay grade!
"@caravanstudios Pick me, pick MaryJo, pick anybody from #SMEMCHAT. We're all happy to do it!"
@Motley_Su @The_Hockey_Prof but I see you just did like the rest of us and switched to twitter. :)
@caravanstudios  http://t.co/HvKxTXXvZX
"@caravanstudios and then you can participate in the calls, etc."
"@caravanstudios So, join @IAEM for free by picking a sponsor. After you join, fill out the form to joint the Emerging tech caucus."
@Motley_Su It was horribly broken earlier. Still limping in places.
"@caravanstudios Sponsor is referring to being a member of IAEM. Nothing to do with webinar. Once a member, you can join the caucus."
@caravanstudios @Jdlazo @Alisha_Beth and that's how good apps are built!
"@sct_r @redheadedkelly @Jdlazo I've sponsored people I've never even heard of! Not sure how that happened, but it's all good. :)"
"@sct_r @redheadedkelly @Jdlazo well, yeah. When you join, you pick the name of the existing member who ""invited"" you."
"@redheadedkelly @Jdlazo pick one of the names flying by in #SMEMCHAT and select them from the ""who sponsored you"" list! :)"
@disaster_dave Is that your polite way of saying it seems like the worst idea ever??
@caravanstudios @MaryJoFly @IAEM You better be interested in participating!
@disaster_dave I'll bet that has the PH world a little anxious ...
@caravanstudios @Jdlazo @Alisha_Beth we use our phone dialing system (same as employees) and they get a call. Push a button to take the gig.
"@caravanstudios @Jdlazo @Alisha_Beth that sounds cool, Unfortunately, many of our volunteers do not have smartphones!"
Will any of my #SMEM compatriots be at #defcon next week?
I wish TweetDeck were available as an Android app. Makes life so much easier.
blerg. work iPad so dead it's been on the charger for 15 minutes and still won't boot up!
@Jdlazo I got that done before my day off!
@caravanstudios that's what happens here when somebody is leading too. I think no leader today. #SMEMchat
"@Jdlazo yeah, plus I'm bouncing between screens working on @iaem presentation with my co-presenters on #hangouts."
@Jdlazo @caravanstudios @Alisha_Beth Oops. My bad. I missed the track change. :P
"@Jdlazo @caravanstudios in Seattle area, @Alisha_Beth did basic class for all affiliated groups. Basics remain the same for all."
"@LASDBrink @Jdlazo Wow. Really, just wow. And I thought getting calls about the power being out was bad ..."
@redcrossmom @MaryJoFly @MZennerBertels @Jdlazo @Alisha_Beth Of course the ICS slide would require much explanation to my young members.
@MaryJoFly @MZennerBertels @Jdlazo @Alisha_Beth That's awesome!
@MZennerBertels @MaryJoFly @Jdlazo @Alisha_Beth I will look on Monday and see if I made a training outline. Sometimes I don't though.
"@Jdlazo @eTechOps that was my exp as well. Had to have basics of #SM first, then talk about #VOST. Also sent several to #PER304."
"@Jdlazo @Alisha_Beth It was primarily my cross trained #hamradio #CERT people. As a ham pointed out, #SMEM is really just message traffic."
"@Jdlazo @Alisha_Beth Mine was ~2 hours, as that's how long our monthly meetings are! And yes, prep for #VOST. #SMEMchat"
@caroldn mine's not a particularly good strategy for household relations though. :P
@Jdlazo I've done one. @Alisha_Beth has done one too. #smemchat
Woah. I can actually participate in #smemchat this week!
"@caroldn I always assume everything is somebody's else's fault, until it's proven otherwise, Makes life simpler. :P"
"@WUWritingCenter @WaldenASC Well, I would say more like limping ..."
@CherylBle Thanks! I think I was travelling at the time and failed to make an actual note of it.
@CherylBle didn't you recently post a link to a service that will remove your addy from mailing lists? Can you repost? I googled but failed.
@KING5Seattle I think you reported that too soon! Still wonky out there on the interwebs ...
and now the giant and needy @ButtersOK has opened the back of the sofa (it's super strong velcro) and is inside my chair. #LifeWithCats
It figures that #facebook would have a meltdown when I actually need to do something on it..
@PSETalk yay!
@CharlieFrid and possibly twurds
"This might be a first. I answered power outage questions via #phone, #hamradio, #smem, and #email. #emlife"
@jshirron I'm pretty sure there were on my face when I left and @Alisha_Beth checked the parking lot for me!
@PNWAbbeyE but we appreciate it!
"@PSETalk ouch, big one. I'm guessing this is ours too?"
@PSETalk I'm hearing the Jeapordy tune in my head now . . . :P
I really wish I could find my glasses. My eyes are going to hurt by the time I finally go home. #EMlife
@PSETalk thanks for working late!
"Hey @psetalk, any idea how many customers are out due to Algona/Auburn outage or ETA for crew arrival?"
@KING5Seattle blown transformer and down lines in Algona. PSE enroute.
@annakm66 also many fire units on scene or enroute.
"@annakm66 transformers in Algona. Also mult brush fires along UP tracks, which are closed. PSE enroute for down lines"
"Hey @wsdot_traffic, if you're wondering why your cameras on 167 near Algona are wonky, just had a transformer blow down there."

Somehow misplaced my glasses between Renton and my office. Going to have to a thorough sweep of the truck when i get home.

@disasterstudent @Jdlazo that and there are so many more accurate and quicker options available. TTY is VERY slow.
"@Jdlazo it's the speech to text that would be hard to overcome. Like asking Google Voice to do it, with audience that uses modded English."
"@Jdlazo Sounds like proof to me! To clarify, it should be technically possible, but not offered by vendors due to low demand/high dev cost"
@Jdlazo You would have to contact each and every vendor and ask if they can do it. That's the only proof you'll get!
"@Jdlazo in working with my deaf and hard-of-hearing community, find that almost none had TTY. Used email, SMS, and video relay. #smem"
"@Jdlazo it's technically possible, but not aware of any vendors. Would require on the fly voice to text, which often sucks"
@MDeyerin then it would make coffee for the janitor every night!
@Jdlazo can't be required to provide service that doesn't exist. ADA requires reasonable accommodations. Cell and voip have to register too.

@Academy911 @sintixerr @Alisha_Beth everybody's opinions are biased. Framed by personal experience. Not bad if recognized by opinion holder.
"@Alisha_Beth @sintixerr Conversely, I ask my students to express opinions, some of them really struggle with it. Lack critical thinking."
@sintixerr @Alisha_Beth Indeed. Opinions aren't facts until you scientifically prove them!
"@Alisha_Beth @sintixerr research in high school &amp; college is taught more as ""read some stuff, regurgitate it, cite it"". No actual research."
@Alisha_Beth @sintixerr Heh. That's what makes me leery of qualitative research. Though it often gets coded into quantitative data.
@sintixerr @Alisha_Beth @thetimemagazine I know! I find it disconcerting to get magazines from the future in the mail.
"@Alisha_Beth @sintixerr Great value in both. It's why oral traditions of many indigenous people save their tribes. Not scientific, but true."

@Ctlshft @poplifegirl generational groupings are just one of many that can inhibit/enhance understanding.
@Ctlshft @poplifegirl Yep. And forcing people to consider those differences in their own context (groups) promotes understanding.
@Ctlshft @poplifegirl I still believe that though!
@poplifegirl @Ctlshft Have fun. Hope it's good!
@Ctlshft @poplifegirl No. People don't realize the variety in the people around them and this causes conflict.Generational is only 1 example
@Ctlshft @poplifegirl I agree with speed/access. Still many people who have never gotten on plane. Most people have Internet access.
@Ctlshft @poplifegirl I've watched people have true moments of clarity when they actually consider the diffs of the people around them.
@Ctlshft @poplifegirl You sound pretty sure of that! To ignore the differences that shaped our lives is counterproductive.

"@TheFireTracker2 @emgis @Kim26stephens yep, exactly."
"@TheFireTracker2 @emgis @Kim26stephens I does say you can't repeat it for your own gain, which may be what prevents the media from using."
@TheFireTracker2 @emgis @Kim26stephens I disagree. Says scanners exempt from listening. Doesn't say you can repeat what you hear.
@TheFireTracker2 @emgis @Kim26stephens FCC says:  http://t.co/q9x9yWaUWo. There's a note there about a recent Supreme Court decision tho.
@TheFireTracker2 @emgis @Kim26stephens Their site is pretty bogged down tonight! I tried there first. Can't get in.
"@TheFireTracker2 I know it covers more than that, because it also covers cordless phones for certain."
@TheFireTracker2 @emgis @Kim26stephens have a link? This was a topic around the office today and I want to find a real answer!
"@emgis @Kim26stephens Just saying that the law clearly says you cannot disclose what you hear. Largely ignored I think, but still there."
"@Kim26stephens @emgis I remember back in the day, media couldn't report on what they heard on scanner due to this law. Had to confirm."
"@therobdale that article says they pled guilty. Also, predates FISA and Patriot Act, which made some changes to EPCA."
@therobdale I meant the person providing the feed shut it down.
@Kim26stephens US Code relevant to disclosure of wireless transmission (which include scanners).  http://t.co/LdokWJgBSY #smem
Looked up answer to my question and Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 does say it's illegal to disclose scanner info to others.
@gcolleenm My point was that people who tweet what they hear may be breaking the law. #smem
"@gcolleenm Last night they did shut down the main Boston feed, but several others are still up and running."
an #smem scanner head should know this. It used to be illegal to divulge what you heard via scanner. Did that change and I missed it?

@cgaylord just came to the same conclusion. Holy crap.
@kitchenmage they are essentially real time. Delay is network induced and variable.
signing off for real now. Lord knows what will happen in the six hours before I get up.
@TheFireTracker2 did you tweet too much?
TweetDeck spell check problem fixed. Installed into Chrome. Uses Chrome spell check. first world problem solved.
"@sethmnookin hey, at least you got solid confirmation on something! A rare thing tonight. :)"
@nfldraftscout @Bornabuckeye Cambridge scanner is still yapping in my ear.
and tomorrow I need to find a spell checker for TweetDeck ...
"Eyelids are dropping, phone is beeping incessantly that it needs power. Work comes early. Sleep is important."
WHDH just stated that they have confirmed one suspect has been shot and killed. At least that's what I think I heard.
"@EMgrB yeah, saw it."
"@Tarantino4me they are citing a source, though not by name."
@garytx my scanner seems to be about 45 seconds behind yours ...
@Tarantino4me several print media outlets are reporting it as true though. The Boston Globe seems to have been first.
@helpingheroespr Find better stations! I'm watching WHDH out of Boston via their live stream. They are on-scene.
"@EMgrB @alertnewengland No, I think it's Mt. Auburn, but can't find it in the scroll now."
"@EMgrB @alertnewengland crowd at hospital is likely due to injured person from the incident being taken there. Prolly media, etc."
@MikeIsaac @TheFireTracker2 @coulterjones Just saw a 7700 squack for a inbound flight from Brussels to SFO
@alertnewengland @EMgrB Did hear that they have a large crowd gathering at one hosp and were requesting extra officers for crowd control.
@Tarantino4me I've seen some pretty bad oppsies on twitter though too. Just quicker to correct.
@YourAnonNews they are a joke ...
@Tarantino4me plus FBI and something called the Diplomatic Service or something like that. Many acronym jackets running around.
@katestarbird That's what I'm thinking. No weps visible on him. Might be case of bad timing.
@EMgrB they probably don't even know they're being talked about. It's the middle of the night and the PIO is sleeping.
"WHDH just said ref guy proned out on ground ""we don't know who it is, but it's someone"". Honesty is good."
@wapio3021 we've got it up on the big screen and I've seen it a few times now. Looks like a windbreaker with lettering on the back.
"@wapio3021 not the one I saw. I saw a guy in sweats, proned out on the street."
@aalkeilani @EMgrB what's the source on that?
@paleofuture @firefighterjp They're also saying he doesn't fit the description originally given and has no visible weapons.
WHDH has incredible video. Holy cow.
@cgaylord proving themselves irrelevent. I'm watching Boston news.
"@garytx Maybe just a case of wrong place, wrong time"
@MaryJoFly @firefighterjp @TheFireTracker2 and this pretty well makes my earlier case for local vs national ...
@kitchenmage watching  http://t.co/faodgMbBvG now and listening to Cambridge scanner
@GabyDinkin thanks. Go the other feed up on the TV.
"@angeles13 they have their website too, but it's a little laggy at the moment."
@angeles13 Radio Reference is the app you want for mobile.
"@Tarantino4me @STEWest trying to pull that up, but site is SLOWWWWWW"
"@angeles13 get a scanner app and listen live. having trouble with it on desktop, but mobile app is working well. Slight lag."
@Tarantino4me @GingerGibson and that should be a surprise to exactly nobody!
really annoying that no national news has live #watertown #cambridge info right now.
@garytx and no guarantee at this point that they're actually the right people.
@GingerGibson @Tarantino4me Indeed. I'm hearing one thing and seeing tweets with alternate info. Takes trained ear to sort out the chaos.
sounds like they've got the 2nd one in #watertown
@Tarantino4me it's way worse when you're the dispatcher.
"@STEWest No kidding. And I just keep thinking we haven't even hit the 19th and 20th yet, which have historical bad juju."
@firefighterjp @MaryJoFly @TheFireTracker2 this week can't be over soon enough. But I don't get a break until a week from tomorrow.
"@MaryJoFly @firefighterjp @TheFireTracker2 #LODD, carjacking, poss middle eastern males armed with guns. Tweet stream is a blur ..."
@MaryJoFly @firefighterjp @TheFireTracker2 and now I won't feel so bad about missing #smemchat tomorrow.
"@MaryJoFly @firefighterjp @TheFireTracker2 Funny how we always come full circle to ""it's about the relationships"". :)"
"@firefighterjp @MaryJoFly @TheFireTracker2 I think if local EM takes time to ask you to use a diff hastag, your response shouldn't be F U."
"@TheFireTracker2 @firefighterjp @MaryJoFly if me and local media can be on same page, don't really care about national."
@firefighterjp @TheFireTracker2 @MaryJoFly Good relationships with local media are critical so they will look to me first.
"@MaryJoFly @firefighterjp @thefiretracker2 for me, always local. National is irrelevent to anything I'm doing in the first 24 hours."
"@firefighterjp @MaryJoFly @bradenframe Survivors dude, not victims!"
@bradenframe @firefighterjp @maryjofly My PIO is typically in bed when the excrement hits the fan ...
@firefighterjp @TheFireTracker2 @MaryJoFly Depends on which folks. I want my info to go to local people.Local people look to local sources.
@bradenframe @maryjofly @firefighterjp I still argue with some ICS instructors about value of #sm at all!
"@firefighterjp @MaryJoFly as a local person, I follow local media first to follow stuff in my area. As EM, I also send info to local media."
Just when you thin this week can't get any worse. #LODD.
@MaryJoFly @firefighterjp I think national should adapt or be ignored. I'm thinking strictly as a local EM here and what is helpful to me.
@firefighterjp @MaryJoFly that was pretty much my point too! Sometimes going with the flow is the right thing to do.
"@TheFireTracker2 Well, emergency bacon would be a very critical thing."
@MaryJoFly @firefighterjp I agree with that. Noted some confusion in the feed last night from ppl in the tagged but uninvolved town
Decided to poll all local venues for large event list for remainder of year. Enthusiastic positive response! #planning
@bradenframe wish i could join. Hard during work hours though. #smemchat
@northlandfox part of moral of story here is recognition of diff between rapid and short events vs slow building and long ones. #smem
@northlandfox @MaryJoFly @firefighterjp point of #smem should not be to generate resource response tho. Should be to help public stay safe.
"@northlandfox @maryjofly @firefighterjp seemed to rapidly evolve more refined description that was more helpful, but was ignored by far away"
Tomorrow is going to be a heartbreaking day. Can't imagine what it's going to be like for the folks of West.
"@MaryJoFly @firefighterjp it started early in the incident. National news kept saying it was in #waco, but finally adapted!"
"@firefighterjp actually, I would hope my #smem buddies would put the smack down on the offenders and the would adapt. I would be busy!"
"@firefighterjp agreed. But if you're going to be helpful in #smem, seems like you should be willing to change and do as the locals do!"
@firefighterjp It's like if somebody came to #auburnwa and kept referring to it as #seattle. Not helpful! #smem
@firefighterjp I guess the morale is to figure out who the locals are and follow them! #smem
@firefighterjp it seems logical to me to just follow along to what the locals were using. Lots of national folks were using other stuff.
#smem what's the rationale for using a hashtag for an indirectly involved community instead of using one for the actual impacted city?
"Appears self deployed. So much for NIMS. @jaykelly26: Check out @iamed_nc who is in West, TX | #WestTX #Waco #smem"
"@firefighterjp I'm guessing special. It's still too hot to enter, so no way to tell what happened yet. Gonna have a lot of search in AM."
@firefighterjp wayyy to early to tell. But they are well equipped for Hazmat and locals aren't.
@oremergencymgr @caroldn daylight is going to be a horrible thing there.
"@oremergencymgr @caroldn there's an app for that!! but they were battling 20-30 MPH winds too, so expanded quickly."
"@caroldn @oremergencymgr listening to scanner, they had perimeter of some sort up quickly. were telling incoming to be prepared to show ID."
noting the weariness starting to creep into voices on scanner. Hardest thing when your own are involved.  #westexplosion
"Old habits die hard. Everytime the scanner app on my phone gets fuzzy, it pick it up and wiggle it around as though it has an antenna."
@ventimocha sounded like a herd! Prompted hubby to actually get up from his WOW game to see what was up.
@jonrags that would prompt a new use for the shotgun!
@Jdlazo @densaer per @wacotrib it's family owned.
@densaer It was on the Waco Tribune TL. Will see if I can find it again.
A whole herd of Chinooks just flew over the house. Always somewhat disturbing this time of night ...
@garytx @bradenframe figured it was the county. Typical in rural areas.
"@bradenframe @garytx my point was that he could have been the volunteer EMS Director, representing EMS. There probably is no EM Dir."
"@bradenframe @garytx there are very few ""only"" volunteers in small towns. Vols are the professionals they have."
"@BOBHANDTV nobody is in West. It was evacuated. I however am in Seattle, working #smem"
@WilliamsonTara @nycarecs @YourAnonNews but it's not in #waco. It's in #WEST.
@bradenframe @garytx Every EMS has to have a Director.
"@garytx Do you have any confirmation of that fatality report, other than the widely quoted EMS Director? Not nitpicking, just querying."
@STEWest @jgarrow Indeed. Though I prefer rum to scotch ...
"@piersmorgan @CNN Hey, it's not in #Waco. Don't freak out the people who live there."
@STEWest @jgarrow Was interesting listening to them trying to figure out what to do with 2nd chopper when the only pad was occupied.
@MichaelMWalter @densaer Distance is a difficult concept sometimes when you come from a place where you can cross 3 states in a day ...
@MichaelMWalter @densaer Also seeing #waco
@CharlieFrid We had a LORAN we used to take on SAR missions. Until I broke the antenna ...
"@CharlieFrid Just struck by dispatch evolution. When I started, we didn't have reverse 911, let alone Internet. Now all on global stage."
"Lest anyone forget, this is national Telecommunicators Week. And boy have we heard some great dispatching this week."
"@chiefb2 @SamuelOrozco07 note, that photo attributed to an incident from several years ago, NOT tonight's (which occured after dark)"
@garytx Sometimes you're just too cool ...
"Is it my imagination or is CNN having a really hard time this week? Monday = behind on everything, now jumping to conclusions. #smem"
"Just sent msg to my #CERT team, thanking them for being there if our day ever comes. Also reminded them to #seesomethingsaysomething."
@caroldn have to hope that investment yields a viable suspect at least.
@caroldn it probably just crashed their system at that point!
"@Eric_Holdeman And Waco. Different circumstances, but same sureal feeling."
"@Alisha_Beth Heh. I took it as ""quit bothering us today""!"
@caroldn CNN has been behind the game the whole time.
"@disasterstudent no, that's dumb bad guy."
"@Tarantino4me @TheFireTracker2 major news sources are reporting it as true, but first responders are still trying to use them."
@Alisha_Beth @magenta_3 @MariaAguilar Boston area Red Cross says they have enough blood to meet need. Was in their feed.
"@KIRORadio @DoriMonsonShow the fact that they didn't all go off tends to fly in the face of ""well planned"", thankfully."
@bradenframe had same thought. We switched it off in our EOC in favor of something else.
@densaer it was really great to hear them say on radio to push info via #sm. #smem
@Tarantino4me  have seen what appear to be confirmed reports of bombs. Were reported by local media. Will see if i can find now.
@TheFireTracker2 they did say on scanner that EOD was detonating one.
@YourAnonNews or just donate blood and save the hospital operators for urgent issues. Always a need for donors. #Boston #BostonMarathon
@SeattleTattoo Can't wait 'til this year's show!
@YourAnonNews I have students say that to me every semester. Scares me.
"Dear @petco: please make it easy to change repeat deliveries. Or to find your ""chat with a rep"" button. Luckily deleting my order WAS easy."
"Hope the #Gwinnett suspect doesn't have Twitter. Real-time photos of SWAT and other responders are interesting to public, helpful to supect."
I'm always bummed when I learn that people without real #EM experience are hired into key EM positions. Why do we bother too hone our craft?

"@caroldn that's a good point, but I'm sure we can figure something out."
@Academy911 @Alisha_Beth short answer: not enough. That's why we need to recruit  volunteers who do.
@Academy911 @Alisha_Beth kinda hard to have spontaneous volunteers for an event that requires pre-registration!
@Alisha_Beth Our volunteers are already comped. I think mostly we need to have tech available to them if they don't already have their own.
@Alisha_Beth I'm hoping next year we can get volunteers to live tweet from every session! #piepc

@TheRedElm we tend to see people in fear after a large event elsewhere. They come seeking information to alleviate their fear.
"@TheRedElm it is a fine balance, but I find they often seek info from a fear perspective. Want them to leave with less fear, more power."
Just learned that my fav researcher is now faculty at the same school I am. Exited for #gender #disaster research collaboration! #EM
@TheRedElm need to capitalize on existing fear and turn it into empowerment!

#atriskpop gap ID: svc providers want info via #smem. Don't seem to know it's available.

More #atriskpop stats: govt pushes emergency info via their own tv and radio stations. Virtually no svc providers get info from there.

"Lest you think I only tweet my unhappiness with Dell, I also post #GoatTweets becuase they make me smile.  http://t.co/9dDhGcBt"
@DellCares It didn't go anywhere. I did a live chat and they promised me a phone call at my desk btw 1-5. No all came. I'm out 'til Thurs.
@MDeyerin @CherylBle awesome!
"@DellCares yeah, so, this was a massive fail. Your tech called my house, where I wasn't for a week, then cancelled my service call."
Got to offer up resources for an #EMAC request for the first time. Paperwork is done. Waiting has commenced. Interesting process. #smem
@DellCares Your critical BIOS update fried the computer. It's getting a new motherboard on Tuesday. Way to go ...
"Well, @dellcares, your critical bios update for our $4000 AlienWare laptop just turned it into a brick. Nice job ..."
"Finally in the air and on my way home! What a day. I love tweeting from 30,000 feet to."
"Seriously @AlaskaAir I love you, but after my 9 hour wait, I couldn't board because my rez was cancelled. Fixed by gate agent but what a day"
Congrats to @BrianDoran5 for landing a much coveted @F5networks internship. Rock it!
"Did not expect to be sitting in the San Diego airport working on #sandy support, yet here I am."
I need to go find power. All the seats with outlets re currently occupied by people who aren't using them. #longday
@danllewis I finally power cycled e iPad and that at least forced it to quit trying. Now I can tweet again!
"I am sooooo tired. By the time I get home from #IAEM12, I will have been up for 23 hours. This was not in the plan."
"@densaer that was the obvious answer, but I can't get it to delete either!"
@graygusa @AlaskaAir agreed. Alaska is my fav. I have MVP status.
I have a really stupid question for the #nerdherd.  My ipad got stuck updating apps and now I can't use those apps. How do I fix? #smem
"@AlaskaAir just FYI, an $8 food voucher for a 9 hour delay is not really sufficient. We've sat here through lunch and dinner . . ."
@AlaskaAir they're flying a new part for our plane in from either SEA or LAX. They're not sure which. But they're bringing snacks!
"@AlaskaAir yeah, no update. I can hear them on the radio, trying to find the mechanic to give an update. Computer glitch on the plane."
@AlaskaAir gate agents are busy rebooking. Only people with mobile access have heard the new projected time. Kind of a goat rope in SAN.
"Made it to SAN an hour early, but now we've been hit with a 2 hour delay to SEA. Apparently @alaskaair is having a bad day."
"@katestarbird thank you so much for the link to EPIC. Reading from 30,000 feet now. :)"
"hello from 30,000 feet!"
"@rusnivek @schuback @alisha_beth @eric_holdeman @mdeyerin would love to, but flight doesn't get in til 1400 local time. #SMEMChat"
@katestarbird thanks!
@katestarbird any chance you can DM me that full citation? Sounds like something to build on.
@CharlieFrid @schuback @alisha_beth @iaem Reno. Then San Antonio in 2014.
"@katestarbird @gislio It does however point to the need for official sources to get on the situations quickly, becuase ppl make stuff up!"
"@katestarbird @gislio yeah, I think it's pretty safe to say that more bad info goes over SM simply becuase it's quick and easy."
@gislio @Alisha_Beth @katestarbird hmmmm. Interesting and relevant. Wonder how that would be researched and vetted. Pondering ....
@Alisha_Beth are you people airborne finally??
"@Alisha_Beth @katestarbird @gislio I can't figure out exactly what this convo is about, but I'm a grad student who just got ok to study SMEM"
and this nerd is off to bed
@mkelly007 They were all over it! Already fixed. Just waiting for DNS to propagate.
"@mkelly007 @OhioDisasterDad Yeah, us nerds have geek things to do tonight. I had to get a misdirected domain pointed in the right direction"
"#iaem12 was awesome, but I could have done without the 0030 push via the app, inviting me to next year's conference!"
@leahmcelrath @YourAnonNews I hope it works out for you and the people you are trying to help.
"Three stages of disaster: denial, deliberation, decision. People might get stuck in the first two. Those people might die. #IAEM12"
"@caroldn I know. Just ends up costing everybody more. Like the ""food drive"" in Ohio yesterday . . ."
"@Tarantino4me my work email sent me the ""your mailbox is almost full"" MSG yesterday. Had to remote in and delete . . ."
"@caroldn they also notice one person needing ""stuff"" and ignore the 500 saying ""send cash""."
"@YourAnonNews they are useless, except as local food bank donation. Disasters need cash to agencies, not random stuff."
@leahmcelrath @YourAnonNews so don't give it to the Red Cross. There are many agencies you can partner with who have est delivery routes.
@YourAnonNews @leahmcelrath agencies can stretch your dollars and they have established delivery routes/methods and will be allowed in.
"@YourAnonNews @leahmcelrath I know people want to help, but the very best thing to do is donate cash to established relief agencies."
Congrats to my colleague Dr. Jane Kushma on winning the IAEM Academic Recognition award. #IAEM12 cc: @JSUNews

Cool! USGS working on earthquake early warning systems like they have in Japan. Up to 1 minute warning. #IAEM12
"#IAEM12 mobile app wonkiness. Different versions in circulation, with different times. My iPad says one thing, my droid something else!"
Wow!  http://t.co/Z8nj5zu5 has a fascinating display of how our world has changed. Huge impact on #EM community. #IAEM12
"If any of the #WA peeps at #IAEM12 run into Phyllis Mann, let her know she won a cool award!"
@rusnivek @CherylBle @schuback @Alisha_Beth I will be back in SEA Friday afternoon.
"So, my fine #SMEM peeps, I just got official approval to change my PhD dissertation to an SMEM topic. Bring it! #IAEMemt"
@densaer @toddjasper I almost snorted water out my nose at that one!
mini rant: Reporter just said someplace has to rebuild the road every year due to storm damage. Maybe it's time to move the damned road!
@sct_r @densaer @bradenframe I put in the official request today to change my PhD dissertation topic to SMEM. Maybe I can work that in ..
"If you're not in the impact area, the best way to help with #sandy is to donate money to legit relief organizations. Not stuff, money!"
"@Alisha_Beth for some reason, my devices failed to show me your tweet until I got back to my room. Oh well."
"Hey @Alisha_Beth, I want to join the ETC. #IAEM12 #iaemtech #IAEMETC"
"@bradenframe @densaer no, not at all. Just need force multiplier to handle volume."
@densaer @bradenframe @townshipofbrick one I'm following on FB and they are slammed. Can't keep up (think it's just one person) #smem #vost
@bradenframe @densaer I'm just talking about offering remote help to some. They get same questions over and over. Remote ppl could answer.
@bradenframe @densaer brought in people to supplement existing skill set (same thing going on now).
@bradenframe @densaer maybe not. I've accepted help mid-stream.
"@densaer not sure, except to identify them and offer help. Might be hard for them to verify credibility. #vost #smem"
Watching small jurisdictions in #sandy area trying desperately to keep up with #sm and losing the battle. Probably don't know about #smem.
@krobertory that is super awesome!
@saraestescohen @cheeky_geeky @JetBlue stated on their feed that it was taken by one of their employees at the Delta gate.
@adamscrowe I bought your book! I expect an autograph. :) thinking about using it for my undergrad Public Info course.
Sagarin's talk is making me want to redo my course syllabi into something more uniquely adaptable. Wonder if it work online? #IAEM12
Sagarin: issue your challenge broadly and engage people you wouldn't normally connect with. #IAEM12
Sagarin: stop giving orders and start issues challenges. Makes people more adaptable. #IAEM12
Sagarin: how do we start becoming adaptable again? #IAEM12
Nature makes systems that work well. We tend to mess them up. #IAEM12

Better to learn from your success instead of your failures. This is how nature thrives. #IAEM12
@MaryJoFly @alisha_beth I do it too! Just don't normally tweet on people I know! #IAEM12
Symbiotic partnerships are critical in nature and applicable to human systems. #IAEM12
@MaryJoFly @alisha_beth funny to see her referred to as Griswold!
Nature uses redundancy and decentralization to deal with problems. We can too! #IAEM12
"We want to be adaptable, but we don't know how. #IAEM12"
Fascinating perspective on what we can learn from nature that can be applied to EM. #IAEM12
@clarissaalsto16 I'm not your aunt!
Hmmmmm. This morning I was following more than 400 people and more than 400 were following me. Now twitter says ~350 each. #strange
Hearing a lot about leaving your comfort zone at #IAEM12. Seems to be a trend across sessions.
@adamscrowe so I've been told!
"@redcrossmom I cannot. The family is working the resources available, but haven't located her yet."
Leadership Symposium day 2. Speaker Rafe Sagarin. #IAEM12

"@redcrossmom long story. But no, appears it was down when she tried. So she called relatives. Thanks for local shelter #"
Does anybody have contact with responders in #BrickTownship #NJ? I'm aware of insulin dependent person trapped by flood water. #sandy #smem
"@krobertory @WeatherChannel in my part of the country, we use ""shelter in place"" for any event that requires you to stay put."
"@KING5Seattle you really should remove that fake ""shark in NJ"" photo from your Facebook feed. And use Snopes ... http://t.co/2DNbjxsM #sandy"

@OCCC @Jdlazo yay! Thank you for monitoring and being responsive. #IAEM12
"@ChrisChange: people don't resist change, they resist being changed. #IAEM12"

"@MaryJoFly ok, just forked over my credit card. Seems much better than the wifi!"
Wow. USCG used 3 million miles of containment boom during Deepwater Horizon. That's a lot of boom! #IAEM12
@MaryJoFly is it working pretty well?
USCG speaker talking about this morning's #sandy activities as part of #iaem12 update. Nearly real time.
#IAEM12 #iaemtech anybody using ATT data at the conf? Thinking about buying for the week if it's better than the free wi-fi.
"@CrisisCommons @LiamPomfret I get what it is, but need tech that adapts to behavior, not try to make behavior conform to tech. Losing battle"
"Apparently by skipping the debates, I missed the fact the Romney has said he will cut FEMA. Scary proposition."
@densaer someday I will quit being cheap and pay for my own connection!
@CrisisCommons @LiamPomfret seems counterintuitive to tell people in crisis to read a website about how to tweet. Proper tweets??
"Free wi-fi is getting saturated. Sad day, #IAEM12"
Strange tech issues in main conference room today. I think somebody keeps leaning on the light switch! #IAEM12
@EMgrUMB they said by the end of the year. #IAEM12
@MaryJoFly I actually use TweetCaster. Like it pretty well. Just had to figure out the list feature.
"@CraigatFEMA was replaced at #iaem12 by a preview of the new website. Not exactly a fair trade, but exciting none the less."
Hurrah for new @iaem website! #iaem12
"So cool that IAEM is truly international now, with solid representation from around the world. #iaem12"
@mkelly007 I figured it out!
"I just followed everybody in the #iaem12 stream, but can't figure out how to make lists in the twitter client. Hmmmmm . . ."
@mkelly007 @OCCC that's pretty common for all big venues. Hotel staff can better direct first responders since they know where we are.
Ugh. Major hotel tech failure at #IAEM12. Sound system fubar. Or they're rebroadcasting #sandy wind sounds

WCATWC Bulletin #4: Tsunami recorded with small amplitutes in SE AK. Forecast for S Cental AK below 30 cm. Same warnings in effect. #bcquake
"@TheRedElm @TheFireTracker2 @sct_r husband's company sells the product to make it happen, but I won't go there either ..."
"@jackiesheldon their e-mail and teletype products are working, but website can't handle the surge."
"@jackiesheldon @GregorySGuthrie Those websites may be down, however the network and the WCATWC are both operating at capacity."
"@TheRedElm @TheFireTracker2 @sct_r It doesn't to me, since most websites don't have surge capacity. They could, but won't spend the $$$."
"@tsunamisteph it appears that Tofino made a local decision to evac, not based on official warnings. Interesting indeed!"
"@TheFireTracker2 @sct_r @theredelm best reason ever to sign-up for their email products, which arrive almost immediately. No web needed."
@bradenframe @krobertory @densaer I stuck with Gatorade and saltines ...
@tsunamisteph Tofino has activated Tsunami warning system and is evacuating.
"@tsunamisteph Hope there wasn't ice cream in there, melting away!"
"Should go to bed, but waiting on reports out of BC,"
@sct_r @theredelm The trusted source is WCATWC.
"@TheRedElm @tsunamisteph @sct_r That Google map somebody showed was valid data, just not limited to actual warning area."
@bradenframe @densaer had to do that at IAEM last year due to food poisoning. Wasn't pretty ...
@densaer See you here! Bring food.
@garytx I know. Just pointing out we should hear something any moment ...
@TheMatthewKeys @garytx That was three minutes ago ...
@bradenframe @densaer I do have staff 5 floors down. They might quit being my staff if I wake them up for a food run though.
#tsunami confirmed by WCATWC via deep ocean pressure sensor. Warning area same as before.  #bcquake
@densaer I've already switched to jammies mode however.
"If you look at readings, the fault is rumbling N to S. 7.7 was 139 km s, 5.8 was 154 km S, and 4.8 was 202 km S (of Masset). #bcquake"
@densaer Would you quit talking about food??? I'm stuck in a hotel room with only fruits and veggies and I want something more!
@gislio @tsunamisteph The fact that they're responding means they're still there! Good sign ...
@sct_r This has some data associated with and says where it came from:  http://t.co/1M7ZTXZV
@tsunamisteph I'm thinking maybe due to remoteness of area. had same observation though.
Figures. Now I'm hungry and it's almost midnight local time ...
@densaer mmmmm. Love me some Tim Hortons.
"@sct_r haven't tried the link, so not sure it if works (or if I typed it correctly!)."

"@sct_r They just reiterated NO watch/warning for OR, WA, CA and they do not anticipate one."
@tsunamisteph @gislio @schuback @densaer @u62 @femaregion9 @femaregion10 Strongly recommend WCATWC e-mail feed. Had 20 minute lead time.
"Agree with @gislio. Was FYI for WA, OR, CA at last check. @u62 @schuback @densaer @femaregion10 @femaregion9"
@schuback @densaer @u62 @femaregion9 @femaregion10 NWS-WCATWC e-mail.
@kb5zzk I quit a higher ed job for that reason once. But I love being fulltime EM and an adjunct.
@densaer @schuback @u62 @femaregion9 @femaregion10 good assumption. I got first alert at 2309 EDT.
@schuback @densaer I assumed it was a Juan de Fuca. Which could be a good thing. They've had a swarm up there of late. Pressure relief ...
@TheFireTracker2 You just had to go there ...
@kb5zzk That's part of the reason we have an IAEM Theory to Practice subcommmitee in T&amp;E. To bridge the gap.
"@schuback @densaer keep things to a duller roar then, would you??"
"Good grief. Hurricane on the east coast, earthquake and tsunami warning for west coast. EMs all at #iaem12."

@BobSpieldenner need to build in section on #sm and use local SMEs to fill it.
#smemforum participants: ask your non-Tweeting neighbor if they want help setting up account. Did at #wsema and got new person tweeting!
Difficult to exercise #sm due to risk of public misunderstanding. Solution: non public accounts just for exercise and training. #smemforum
Interesting that basic PIO curriculum hasn't really caught up with #sm. #smemforum
Wow! Look at all those new followers I picked up today!
Now up: Mark Clemens from @waEMD to talk about online training for PIOs. #smemforum
"@MDeyerin final thought. We live in an info commodity market. If you're not part of it, you lose credibility. #smemforum"

Audience question: how do you verify crowd sourced info? A: traditional methods or trusted sources. #smemforum
Communities are using #sm to organize themselves in disaster. #smemforum
#sm has given tiny media outlets the ability to be 24/7 news and better serve their community. #smemforum
@gislio heehee! Just goes to show the flexibility of people who use #sm
Don't let the size of your local media discourage you from reaching out to them. #smemforum

"@gislio not here yet, so jumping ahead to @evonnebenedict, @sethlong, and @wastro with a media panel. #smemforum #improvising"
69% of agencies thought federal support would be helpful for reaching their #sm goals. #smemforum

@Alisha_Beth EMD will come do a PA training just for your agency if you want them to!
@Alisha_Beth @MDeyerin @CherylBle attend the PA workshop! Best source of info.
"@CherylBle @mdeyerin it's all ""unofficial"" or ""draft"" at this point.  Tell people to attend the EMD PDA workshops though. #wsema"
@MDeyerin @cherylble we barely touched on that. The changes to process are a killer. Single Cat A and Cat B PW per jurisdiction is one.
@CherylBle @MDeyerin   wait til you get your annual PA brief from EMD. Some of it is done deal. Harder for us on several fronts.
@MDeyerin  yep!
@MDeyerin I was thinking just the opposite! #demotivated

Sad day. Spokane airport not setup for electronic boarding passes. Luckily secuirty line was also short since I had to go thru twice.
Large high profile incidents will involve more jurisdictions and responders than you can fathom. Hard to manage. #wsema
Be positive about outcomes until you know w/certainty that outcome is not positive. Keeps internal morale and productivity up. #wsema
Be very clear internally on who can release information and what they can release. #wsema
Number of false tips and claims in Klaas case tied up a lot of resources. unfortunate reality of big cases. #wsema
Your experience is a great asset in response. It can also work against you if you get stuck in your box. #wsema

Emergency management should be a key player in child abduction response. #wsema
Volunteers are going to come out of the woodwork in a child abduction case. Have a plan to use them instead of turning away. #wsema
Great to hear #CERT mentioned so many times as a resource for child abduction support. #wsema
"In 49% of child abduction cases, the child is murdered in the first hour. #wsema"
"Child abduction is a primary law enforcement response, but requires huge support network from all disciplines. #wsema"
@CherylBle and @WAStateEMA is the #wsema website down or is it just me?

Issue I hadn't thought of: significant Columbia River pollution in event of big Cascadia quake. #wsema

"@disasterstudent @WAStateEMA there isn't really a requirement to do it. There is no law that says we must. We have to do CEMP, but not COOP."
@Alisha_Beth which of you is frick and which of you is frack??
COOP planning should be specific and usable. The people who are going to use it should write it too. #wsema
Lesson learned: COOP can be fun for employees. Give out prizes for participation. #wsema
@CherylBle @TheFireTracker2 the wireless was far less saturated yesterday. Been kinda ick today.
Port of Seattle COOP affects the entire region. Much of our stuff comes brought their facilities. #wsema

@Disaster_Guy we're govt. We have policies for everything! SM is covered in the same one that makes me swear not to download porn. #smemchat
A7: and don't forget that sm is more than just Twitter. #smemchat
A7: have your legal ducks in a row. Know what your requirements are and how you're going to meet them. Was big challenge for us. #smemchat
A7: dive in on your own an learn something about it before trying to sell the concept to agency. #smemchat
@Disaster_Guy Agreed. What I meant was that they have to know we're using it or no connection is made. #smemchat
A6: we use SM nearly every day. have to get public used to it so they know to look during incident. #smemchat
A5: potentially increases access to govt = good. Ex: tweeted about roads and got reply from @wsdot with specific info for me. @smemchat
"A5: I don't really think so. It's a good buzzword, but use of SM does not mean you are transparent. #smemchat"

"@saraestescohen oh, they are, but many were doing things before a policy existed. Had to figure out who was doing what already. #smemchat"
@AnaheimCERT downside is that some of our SM predates our policies so we've had to do some catchup. #smemchat
@AnaheimCERT I think the most important component is being organized about it and clear on who does what. #smemchat
@AnaheimCERT A2.2 our Public Affairs has really embraced SM an we work very closely with them. We've built together. #smemchat

Great resource for Seattle area rental housing:  http://t.co/fz0o6fhB tool for everyday and disasters
Thanks to @schuback we get to watch the sad NOLA pets video.
Federal guidelines define dogs and mini horses as service animals. State or local laws may be broader. Be sure to check as you plan.
Pets Act requires that we shelter turtles. I did not know that!
44% of people who refused to evac for Katrina were because they couldn't take pets. Must plan for pet sheltering! It saves human lives.
Class issue with pets in disasters: people w/resources for hotel could take pets. Those in shelters couldn't.
"After Katrina, 15000 pets were rescued but only 3000 were reunited with owners. All rescued from flood water were positive for heartworm."
Up next: video of sad animals in NOLA after Katrina. Or not. Tech #fail.
Speaker: US building codes are good for #earthquake but need more than codes to create resilient communities.
"High-rise refugees. Many tall buildings fine after Japan #earthquake, but no services available (power, water, sewer, etc.)"
First Japan #earthquake talk I've heard from an engineer. Great perspective!
Temporary housing can't be placed where original housing was if you want to rebuild in the same place. Good thought for recovery planning.
@disaster_dave you're welcome! Always fun. Made a couple new contacts too.
Speaker talking about Israeli field hospital in Japan after #tsunami. I met some of the responders in Israel. #smallworld
Japan #earthquake survivors painted symbols on roof to alert helos of dialysis patients and other needs.
People issuing voice warnings in Japan for tsunami died doing their jobs and saved many thousands of lives in the process. #sad #hero
Cascadia #eq would cause 16.5 foot wave into Seattle. Yikes!
"If tsunami from Cascadia zone, Bellingham will be bad and ""the coast is toast"". We know it, but seeing examples is scary."

"@garytx interestingly, they seem to have very strong support in the school zones."
"@garytx the ones in enforced intersections have some additional  info on them, but in small type."
"@garytx none of ours say ""photo enforced"" but some similar language. Funny, I pass them every day and can't remember what they say."
@garytx the big argument in our city has been about warning signs placed in intersections that don't have the cameras.
"@garytx I'm sort of ambivalent about the cameras. If we were making money, I might feel differently."
"@garytx anecdotally, it seesm that rear-end accidents are less deadly than t-bones.  Can't back that up though."
@garytx  I think I remember more current info that said t-bones were down but rear-end collisions were up. Can't find the reference tho.
@garytx  Here's the story that references the decline in accidents:  http://t.co/FVFQCiqj It's not a current story though.
"@garytx In many places, yes. If you look at the stats on ours though, nobody is making money off them. They're actually costing us."
"@garytx   http://t.co/MtC0Po3o is most recent article, but addresses infractions, not accidents."
@garytx  I will see if I can find the news article.
"@garytx The PD compiled the stats. Full disclosure, they are also my employer! Note that only t-bone accidents decreased. Not other kinds."
"@garytx They do operate cameras in our City. And in spite of the bad press, our t-bone accident rate has dropped significantly."

Quote of the day: Cinco de Mayo isn't that big a deal in Mexico. Mostly it's an American beer makers holiday.
"@caroldn heh. Mines buzzes, hard to ignore!"
"@caroldn though for the record, I don't think we fundamentally disagree. Just diff approaches to same core issue."
"@caroldn I enjoy debating with you! Always logical and factual, which I appreciate. Makes it much more pleasant to disagree peacefully!"
"@caroldn that's precisely why my pub ed is now focused on low income and other vulnerable. They benefit the most, have greatest need."
@caroldn good point! Still not a quick or easy solution. Takes long-term commitment and change.
@caroldn just saying there has to be a common sense approach that allows greatest good for greatest number.
"@caroldn creates confusion though. We say ""no pop-up shelters"" and then we say ""unless you're non-compliant, then go ahead, but no support"""
"@caroldn great for getting in, but narrow halls and small bathrooms can't be quickly fixed."
@caroldn that's exactly my point! Plans need to reflect reality of what will really happen and acknowledge what we're working toward.
@caroldn not here! My only concern really is for the big one since I know resources will quickly be tapped.
"@caroldn we can't support unofficial shelters, so non-accessible community buildings are on their own. Counterintuitive to helping people."
"@caroldn the issue is that I can't house enough people in the buildings we own. If we can't rely on community, people go unsheltered."
@caroldn plus I need to work and stuff.
@caroldn heh. Yep!
@caroldn silly to tell a non-accessible church that they're not allowed to provide refuge and must leave people out in the cold.
@caroldn example: all city buildings are accessible. Shelters potentially in non-city buildings though. We have no control over them.
@caroldn we do build that way now (solution in progress) but much old building stock still in use.
@caroldn 2) other people are willing to step up and help those who need it. I don't think it's unsolved. I think the solutions are in play.
@caroldn two reasons. 1) People live longer with disabilities now. Didn't used to be the large-scale issue that it is now.  And . . .
"@caroldn I live by ""do the most good for the most people"" and if I have to use a building that isn't compliant, I will make it work."
"@caroldn I just don't understand the ""if we can't help everyone, we're not allowed to help anyone"" mentality. Morally, it's reprehensible."
@caroldn agreed! I think the public is smarter than government though and will find ways to make it work without our meddling.
"@caroldn I hate that. I understand need to be ADA compliant, but to ban all from an otherwise viable shelter is silly and can cause harm."

Traffickers often exploit a lack of basic human needs in their victims. #freethegirls #siaconf #sianwr
Avg cost to buy a person in 2009 was $90. Disgusting. Help end the trade in humans. @freethegirls #sianwr #siaconf

"@caroldn FYI, I love seeing you teach! So much energy and fun and always the right info!"
Love teaching #CERT TTT. Always pick up new tips and hints from students.
"@disaster_dave @klout @caroldn @SeattleRedCross @schuback me either, but it seems interesting to me."
"@Alisha_Beth I was supposed to be at Rapid Assessment trng today. Postponed, so finishing out day 3 of CERT TTT as instructor."
@caroldn we were just talking about that in the back room. We've incorporated new info into our #CERT program. Mitchell says he was wrong
@Alisha_Beth I'm a little jealous. I love hearing Bill speak! #CRRS

@Alisha_Beth Never got a chance to say thanks for tweeting my session. Nice to see what I actually said! #PIEPC
@caroldn Wierd. My client never showed my your tweets to me this morning. Just now saw them. Wasn't ignoring you!
Dr. Dan: personal connections can help get things done. #piepc
Dr. Dan: disaster improv is making things happen through perseverence. #piepc
Dr. Dan: take your local work I'd with you on deployments. Can literally open doors! #piepc
Hmmmm. Some tables done eating. No food served to us yet! #piepc
Dr. Dan: we drive where we look.  keep your eye on the right goal. #piepc
Dr. Grady Bray: this is the best conference food I've ever had! #piepc
Dr. Dan: failure to persevere leads to bad outcomes. #piepc
Dr. Dan: people get stuck and can't move forward during disaster. Need to use 5 tools to overcome. #piepc
"Dr. Dan: coping, gratitude, meaning, strengths, team to overcome circumferential trauma. #piepc"
Dr. Dan: need network of 10 close people to stay sane. #piepc
"Hard to tweet and eat, but gonna try! #piepc"
@STEWest it was a pre-planned drill! #PIEPC

If you are at #piepc don't forgot to visit the Bosch exhibit on the 5th floor. Cool toys up there!
Dr. Dan will give more of his presentation at lunch. Huzzah! #piepc
Dr. Dan: will you stay in the game and make a difference of you lose everything? Are you in the game and making a difference now? #piepc
"Dr. Dan: keep a gratitude journal. Write 3 things in it every day. In 6 months, you will be a happier person. #piepc"
"Sad. Dr. Dan thought he had 90 minutes, not 45. Only got to do half his presentation. #piepc"
Dr. Dan: you don't do this job by yourself. You need a buddy or 10. #piepc
Dr. Dan just asked for two volunteers. *crickets*  he picked the NWS guys. #piepc
"Dr. Dan, quoting Frankl: the only freedom that can't be taken from you is the freedom to choose your attitude. #piepc"
Dr. Dan: you need psychological armor to strengthen your passion for battle. #piepc

Dr. Dan: bystanders are powerless givers.

"@caroldn so I don't hear him saying right or wrong, good or bad. Just examples of individual reactions and catagorizing them.  #piepc"
Dr. Dan: exploiters are empowered takers.
Dr. Dan: victims are powerless takers.
Dr. Dan: two types of people in the world. Givers and takers. Takers will suck the life out of you. #piepc
Dr. Dan: collaborate = purpose + passion + persevere. #piepc
Dr. Dan: some people do not become victims even in the case of big disaster. What makes them tick? #piepc
Dr. Dan Diamond: what one word would you use to say how you feel if an earthquake took all your stuff? Was it collaborate? #piepc
"Is there a doctor in the house? Yes! Dr. Dan Diamond, sharing stories from the disaster trenches. #piepc"
Getting ready to kick off #piepc Day 2 with Dr. Dan Diamond.
And now it's time to network and socialize! #piepc
Mass fatality plan should incorporate procedure for catastrophic event where Coroner or Medical Examiner are not able to respond. #piepc
"Always consider that a mass fatality may be result of criminal act, which changes procedures. #piepc"
Full DMORT team costs $1 Million per day for full deployment. Not a local resource for most jurisdictions. #piepc
"Expect to find bodies in strange places after widespread events like pandemic flu. Dumpsters, curbs, outside hospitals. #piepc"
"Dead bodies are not inherently dangerous. Leave them be unless critical to move. If moved, must document thoroughly. #piepc"
Local jurisdictions have huge support role in mass fatality incident. Must be prepared to support adequately. #piepc
@PIEPC yes. Single person (or outlet) shoots video and releases to all outlets.
Ensure local EM plan (CEMP in WA) includes section on mass fatalities and process to support process. #piepc
@PIEPC ohhhhh. Freaky.
@PIEPC you did understand right. Media pool is great use of resources. #piepc
Make distinction between reported dead and confirmed dead. Only Medical Examiner or Coroner can confirm deaths. #piepc
JIC is huge component of mass fatality incidents. Must have one. Watch media reports for info you don't know. #piepc
@PIEPC kitten card??
"Consider psych impact of temp morgue site: if school gym, kids may refuse to go back. Consider parking garage.  #piepc"
Can't cremate or bury a body without a permit. It's attached to the death certificate. Who knew?? #piepc
@PIEPC thanks!
"Data from family members can lead to conflicting data. Mom says no tatoo, sis says has tattoo. Makes task of body ID harder. #piepc"
Mass fatality incident will always require some kind of family assistance center and call-in capability. #piepc
Mass fatality: closed population - we know who is supposed to be dead. Open population: we have no idea. #piepc
Mass fatality is any fatality incident that overwhelms ability to deal. Likely to be smaller number for smaller counties. #piepc
Santa Clara County has a great mass fatality plan to use as a guide. #piepc
"Three different systems in WA: Prosecuting Attorney/Coroner, Coroner, Medical Examiner. WA is only state that has the first one. #piepc"

"Mass fatality planning: we're talking about dead people, just to be clear! #piepc"
"Lowe: go back to your communities and ask uncomfortable questions. Don't accept ""we're ready"". Prove it. #piepc"
Lowe: God sends angels in the form of trained responders to help those in need. #piepc
"Lowe: surprise, speed and violence of attack are what active shooters use. LE must use same. #piepc"
Lowe: infantry tactics are what works in active shooter events. #piepc
Lowe: showed video of courthouse shooting where LE response was 6 minutes after shooting left. All on in-house cameras. #piepc
Lowe: active shooter event will put your city of the map for hours or days. Be ready! #piepc
"Lowe: statistically, shooter kills themselves at first contact or sign of police. Quick contact by LE saves lives. #piepc"
Lowe: statistics show active shooters are not stopped by SWAT. They are stopped by the first person able to take the shooter out. #piepc
Lowe: give media what they need in order to keep them out of harms way. #piepc
Recordings of 911 calls always bring back old memories. This call was from Columbine. #piepc
Just watched a video of a guy pulling a concealed rifle out of his pants. Thought provoking! Where will an active shooter hide guns? #piepc
Bill Lowe from JSU talking about active shooter events. #piepc

Nadolski: migration west is increasing risk in our local communities. #piepc
Oops! Nadolski. Sorry for the typo.  #piepc
Nadlowski: disasters are on the increase. Bigger populations in impact areas. Migration to coasts is increasing risk. #piepc
"Sitting in the back now, can't read the slides. Need better eyes I think! #piepc"
Dr. Bray: brain in crisis perceives time different. Things seem to take longer. #piepc
Dr. Bray: mind under stress records info differently. Can't remember more than 2 things. Keep notes of 3 or more tasks. #piepc
"Dr. Bray: asparagus is strong diuretic. Carry in your kit, store in your EOC. Canned of course! Flushes salt, avoid cramps. #piepc"
Dr. Bray: stress causes salt buildup in cartilage. Causes muscle spasms. Ow! Avoid salt.  #piepc
Dr. Bray: bathrooms need triple amount of supplies during response. See previous tweet on tummy troubles! #piepc
Dr. Bray: eat a small meal every 2 hours during response to ward off tummy troubles. #piepc
"Dr. Bray: don't forget the breath mints for the EOC. Byproduct of stress is ""moose breath""! #piepc"
Dr. Bray: Want to kill a stress headache? Hide in a dark closet for 20 minutes. #piepc
Exited to see Dr. Grady Bray at #piepc. Fantastic speaker!

@TheFireTracker2  #smem  I was actually thinking the more broad sense of large power outages in general. What about NYC? Not car culture.
"@danllewis  hey, I'm coming to Florida in November. Any chance of a tour of your center??"
@TheFireTracker2  #smem #em365 Works fine for the people who still have power or a way to charge their smartphones. Rest are SOL!
How to  communicate w/people during a power outage if they haven't gotten battery or crank radios? Kinda throws #smem out the window. #em365

@caroldn I will get to go to IAEM because I got grant funds for it.
"@caroldn no, I have no out of state travel."
"And for any who might wonder, @caroldn is one of my best buds, even if we don't agree about the DOJ!"
@sfDEMrob @CherylBle one of biggest gaps we found was lack of access to cheap portable radio. that is now our pub ed giveaway for the year.
@caroldn @CherylBle I am!
"@caroldn make that ""or"" money."
"@sfDEMrob @CherylBle we are using concept of ""what do you already have"" for preparedness education. New mindset, more empowering."
@caroldn bottom line is plenty of people to tell EM what we must do. Few willing to invest time our money into helping though.
@caroldn public transport critical since many with different abilities rely on it and all will need transport to DRC.
@caroldn but how to fix? No budgets and can't require partners to fix theirs. Feds face created no-win situation.
"@caroldn Imagine PR nightmare: ""City refuses to open public facility as shelter, fearing DOJ lawsuit"". Why punish all when some can benefit?"
@caroldn Why should I have to exclude people from usable buildings when some CAN use them? Why not let them serve the people they can?
"@caroldn Yes it is, but DOJ doesn't recognize regional efforts and will pass judgement upon locals for what they're doing locally."
"@caroldn That's all well and good, but I don't have any more buildings! City has no more, schools have no generators. So 100 is our limit."
"@caroldn And that being the case, I can only shelter .0014% of my population. All other buildings must remain empty. DOJ's call, not mine."
@caroldn Missing the point again! DOJ doesn't recognize that difference. All shelters must provide all services according to them.
"@caroldn Exactly. All others could stay there, but because some can't, I'm in violation, even though I have other places for them."
@CherylBle Maybe you should give up flying!
"@caroldn DOJ doesn't care about critical diffs, only diffs. Mine is missing showers, transit routes, generator switch, med care."
"@caroldn All meet their requirements for day to day use, but none were built to be emergency shelters. Emergency use is the issue."
"@caroldn Missing the point! All my buildings are ADA compliant, but they cannot provide the same services to all as emergency shelters."
"@caroldn Sure, but that's not what DOJ cares about. They want every person to have equal access at every shelter site. Not possible."
"@caroldn not saying I can't or won't help, just that DOJ is likely to sue us for planning for it since we can't provide equality for all"
"@caroldn don't get me wrong, I can provide great service to those extra .002%, just not in a way that will satisfy the DOJ."
"@caroldn By acknowledging that additional .002% though, makes me subject to DOJ sanctions. No fix for me, as no addl facilities or $$$."
"@caroldn Perspective: 5 years ago, I could shelter 0% of my population. Now, in a DOJ compliant way, .0014%. Non-compliant: .0035%."
"@caroldn I see that we've made huge strides, both in thinking and capacity/capability. All that could be squished in an instant by DOJ."
"@caroldn There hasn't been an EM community for all that many decades! I guess sitting on mass care task force, I have diff outlook than you."
"@sfDEMrob I meant Congress staffers heard, not DOJ. Agree that they ought to go out and try doing the dirty one once or twice."
"@caroldn @sfDEMrob At the recent Big Cities meeting, DOJ rep got a pounding, with congressional aids in attendance. Message was heard!"
@caroldn @sfDEMrob But you're not the wonk headed DOJ attorneys who are interpreting the guidelines! They do not see things reasonably.
@sfDEMrob @caroldn Look at the link to Project Civic Access I sent you earlier Carol. It has guidance and settlements.

@camelama We took my nephew to the Solstice Parade one year. He refused to tell his mom what he saw at the parade. :P
"@caroldn  http://t.co/xZoZPLb is what DOJ is doing. Some great, some very extreme and harmful to overall efforts."
"@caroldn All of our city facilities are ADA compliant, but not all meet DOJ standard for sheltering/FNSS/etc.Nothing I can do to fix."
@caroldn Point is DOJ is not allowing for time needed to change/adapt. Money being directed into lawsuits instead of into needed changes.
@caroldn It should. But most govts don't physically own enough facilities to shelter 10% of their own population. Have to use what is avail.
"@caroldn Now only reasonable solution is to not designate shelters, only pick at time of need. No time for DOJ to butt nose in and sue."
"@caroldn Yes, prioritize is great. DOJ requires that all be equal. No room for prioritization. Thus, Philly saying they're not doing it."
@caroldn @sfDEMrob @TheFireTracker2 DOJ sued Philly because not ALL facilities were EQUALLY accessible. Same thing happening in Seattle.
"@kevinbostrom hey, I made a donation to Lifelong AIDS Alliance a few weeks ago."
@sfDEMrob @thefiretracker2 @caroldn DOJ attitude is that all shelters must be equally accessible to all people. No latitude. Period.
@sfDEMrob @thefiretracker2 @caroldn It's not foot stomping. It's best use of limited resources. No predesignated shelters = no lawsuit.
"@sfDEMrob @thefiretracker2 @caroldn Philly example: Had plan to shelter big numbers, but not all were ADA compliant, so got sued by DOJ."
"@caroldn if we are going to be punished for trying, then why try?"
"@caroldn problem is that by having them, cities risk huge lawsuits from the feds so they are starting to stop having them at all."
"@caroldn Diff perspective on shelters: If the DOJ is going to sue cities for trying their best, why bother since there is no legal mandate."

"@caroldn Problem is that far too many people don't really understand radiation, so the media tries to give comparisons, but they're bogus."

@caroldn I'm actually more worried about my nephews or my mom reading what I post!
@caroldn then I'd have to be more careful!
@caroldn I'm always amused when anybody at all decides to follow me!
@caroldn It's bad to track who unfollows/unfriends you. Only leads to sadness and confusion. :P

@KIRO7Seattle Still not a warning. It's a TSUNAMI INFORMATION BULLETIN. There is no tsunami.
@KIRO7Seattle  http://ptwc.weather.gov/ shows no warnings in effect.
@KIRO7Seattle that link to the tsunami warning is from March 12.
@caroldn Hurrah for considerate people!

Read up on what the Department of Health has to say about potential radiation in Washington:  http://doh.wa.gov/Topics/japan2011.htm
@caroldn Sad that every single death in the US related to this tsunami was preventable if only people would heed warnings.
@KIRO7Seattle Try this info for similar quake and tsunami info.  http://www.pnsn.org/HAZARDS/CASCADIA/cascadia_event.html
@KIRO7Seattle That doesn't really answer @foilfinch question since that uses a Seattle fault scenario and not a Cascadia subduction one.

@KIRO7Seattle Depends on topography. Compare wave heights to topographic maps to get a rough answer.
@kegill Heh! That makes a lot more sense!
@kegill I disagree! Warning means we know time and approximate height. Tornado watch means conditions are right but nothing is spotted yet.
@kegill  http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sew/
"@kegill NWS, then KING, KIROV."
@kegill Oregon and Cali are now too.

"off to bed for my early shift tomorrow. Normally wouldn't be so tired, but I came down with a cold just as this all started. Ugh ..."
@carolARC It's fascinating to see. We spent time on Thursday doing the calculations ourselves to see what they were going to push us to
@carolARC Dunno. Never actually used it. I'm barely literate with plain ol' twitter!!
@carolARC Isn't that what tweetdeck does?
"@carolARC #waflood That's by design. Once the river levels drop, they start dumping from the reservoirs. Record levels there this time."
@carolARC The only downside to all this tweeting is that many organizations simply don't have the capacity or expertise to carry it out.

"@carolARC If Seattle is like most cities around, we're all broke! We may or may not get a federal declaration out of this, which would help."
"@carolARC If the City spent millions on snow plows that sat idle more of the year, or multiple years, people would be mad about that too!"
"@carolARC No, but somebody still has to pay them. Either the City or the neighborhood. Snoqualmie City paid for private contractors to plow"
"@carolARC Gee, I feel so bad for him! He's following the first rule of EM though: BOOT -- Be Out Of Town!"
"@carolARC Well, in nearly every CERT class we do, somebody asks about guns!"

@carolARC Ohhhhh. That would suck.
@carolARC I confirmed it three different ways before sending it to my city staff!
Thankfully the NWS canceled the high wind warning. Of course that means more snow. No wind = no power outages = no need for shelters!
@carolARC haven't found anything

"@carolARC Well, be sure to remind people that shelters will only be setup if they're needed in King County and to stay tuned to their radios"
Found my ham radio. *whew*
"snow here, temperature dropping, a little bit of wind. And for some reason, I can't find my ham radio anywhere!"
"@carolARC Work, home, is there a difference? I'm actually working from home unless things get worse and we stand up our ECC."
"@carolARC Is it just me, or do people actually seem better prepared this year?"
"@carolARC no significant difference. We're either going to get more wind and less snow here in Auburn, or vice versa!"
the snow has started and there's a little wind now. No significant change in the NWS forecast for here.
