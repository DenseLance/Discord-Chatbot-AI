<|startoftext|>Dunno if we're gonna win this game, but we got Rod Masters on organ, Nadia saved a life and got $10k for med school, and we sang happy 99th birthday to Eunice. Good start to 2022! seakraken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a hell of a story to start the year with! Her seats are very near mine. Hockey fans are the best!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The NHL Winter Classic in-studio crew is a little giggly today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. I'm glad you were not at your computer! I hope you also report it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's yard bird count so far: a shit ton of crows, a bunch of little beepy birds, 1 Stellar's Jay, 1 hummingbird, and 2 very lost seagulls.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our local hospital is at 117% capacity right now. It doesn't matter what help you need, you're either not going to get it or it's going to be slow. It's worse than the peak last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The NYE content I'm here for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keeping track of the ever changing hockey schedule is hard, especially when SeattleKraken app, Ticketmaster app, and NHL app all have different info. Pretty sure seakraken aren't playing overlapping games, but . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in a former career, HBD stood for Has Been Drinking. Probably applies here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn you 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today was family gift day, where everybody drew a name a few months ago and had to make something by hand. My cousin made my husband these seakraken chocolates! tasty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You. Everybody else (USPS, ups, FedEx) all seem to be getting here fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. It says I get a refund if it's not here by tomorrow. But a refund isn't all that useful when I need my stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are you even doing with this package amazon? Can I just come pick it up? It's practically driven past my house once already.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Concessions at ClimateArena are 10% off now with an Amex card. Guess I'll be getting one of those now ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's up to 34 degrees at our house on the south end, so it will be interesting to see how this plays out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eh, not let down. Just hoping we get more than forecast! Looks like use supposed to warm up, turn to rain, then back to snow tomorrow. Gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The drive home from Seattle to Auburn WA an adventure. This storm was supposed to bring 1-4" of new snow by 7 PM tomorrow. It's clearly already hit the higher end of that in places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This NWSSeattle alert cracked me up. "Yeah, we just wanted to let you know it started". wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 28 degrees and Seattle still wearing shorts. To a hockey game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never liked the Flyers, but it sure is cool to have them play here. Wish they'd brought Gritty though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is heart breaking. This is the cost of not vaccinating and masking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our WHL team dressed 14 skaters last night, including two guys who just signed. We would very much like our kids to avoid COVID and come back. Makes sense given the transmission rates.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's New Guy In The Box night for the SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy night in the Dub.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had I been paying attention, I would have worn one of my Iggy Sr. jerseys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Iggy was my fav hockey player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know your team is crazy low on players when the pp unit has two rookies in their debut game. SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. My fav player of all time *might* be in the barn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So hypothetically, if you were Jerome Iginla and your son was playing his debut game for SeattleTbirds, would you be in the building?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Funniest part was that for the 30 seconds it took him to make up his mind, he vocally complained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's snowing heavily now. ButtersOK REALLY wanted to go out. He made it this far before turning back. He didn't even turn around. Just backed that thing up. wawx AuburnWA LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Addendum: I can't even appeal the paypal denial because the case doesn't show up in my account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except at least with olds you can usually find a way to talk to a human.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And because they closed the case, there's no easy way for me to remind them of all this info. Guess I'll see if Chase will treat it as fraud and do a chargeback to Paypal. Meanwhile, scammer still scamming. 4/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I check the sellers site and find them using a rotating set of accounts to run this scan on others. Every time you put a purchase in your cart, it takes you to a different paypal account to complete your transaction. I told AskPayPal all of this, but they don't care. 3/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a real USPS tracker, for someplace in the town I live in, but it was issued prior to my purchase and wasn't sent to my address. I use Informed Delivery and that tracking number never showed in my account. My security cam from the day it was "delivered" shows no package. 2/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The longer version of why PayPal sucks: I bought an item. Paid with Paypal on the website of the seller. Seller processes it as a cash advance, so I immediately get an extra $10 hit from my credit card. Shipper provides USPS tracking number. 1/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit paypal. Denying my case because the scammer provided somebody else's tracking number is crap. I can prove that package wasn't associated with my address thanks to USPS Informed Delivery and my security cam showing the mailman with no package.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also, they scrapped the original wait-list and started a new one. I know some folks who are pretty miffed about that, as they fell way down in the reshuffle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our contracts have built-in price increases, so yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't get me wrong. I love my seats and would do this all again! But I'm super disappointed that we basically have to give them away for games we can't attend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all the deposits that went down, there's a limited market for $350 seats. And we don't have the same amenities that other teams do for club seats. We get a GREAT view, but not much else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't even sell them to friends at face though. People behind us gave their's away tonight. Other friends snagged glass seats Friday for $400 for 2. That had to have been at least 50% loss to the owner, before the fees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ouch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have the same rant with the people around us. I'm going to put it in the form of a polite but pointed email to our account rep tomorrow. 7 years of screaming "SIT DOWN" is not going to fly . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of those empty seats are season ticket holders who can even get face value for their seats if they can't go. I don't feel bad for people who bought with the intention to sell, but it sucks for the rest of us. Seahawks have the same issue. Locals only want cheap seats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, they def have some message timing issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're in club. There is occasionally an usher in the 1/2 aisle. There's never one in 2/3. The only more expensive seats are the tunnel suites. It's a rotating cast of "how many people are going to stand through tonight's game" down there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's awful. CPA has big issues with ushers for hockey games. Don't know if they just can't hire enough, don't train them, or simply don't put them where they need to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soooo tired. But it's been so fun!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Guess where I am tonight Seattle hockey fam???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure that's part of the Rootz Assylum track. For kids ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Case in point. This was a live poll I did recently for a room of ~60 mostly government, high level decision-makers. In a session about emerging tech. Gave them the sad news that none of this was emerging and we weren't going to talk about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm enjoying listening to IanFurnessSea calling the SeattleKraken game. Explaining rules as he goes. So many new fans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The comments.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe padresj ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a princess, I'm mildly annoyed by this ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter somehow decided that I should follow the topic "Seattle Kraken". I'm here for it. Especially since I'm going to miss the first hour of the game on TV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, but here's a chicken. Or 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, no. We're already time crunched and we're offering it for Guam. So faster is not better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to teach a remote class until 8 PM tonight. The SeattleKraken game starts at 7. Life is very unfair sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess I'll have to switch to TWA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Navient, please fix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sucks! But I'm glad the NHL takes this seriously and I hope you don't end up actually having COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to work until 8. Husband will be watching downstairs without me. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey EMGTwitter, I have a proposal for our new ICS 300 instructor uniform shirt:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I patiently explain hockey rules to anybody around me who is nice. Or super annoying. I explain it different to them though. :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So, Rempe had a bit of a growth spurt in this extended "off-season". 6'9", 240. Holy crap!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I feel this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their starting pay dropped to something like $45/hr. It's not worth it. I really wanted to teach the cyber courses, but not at that rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a loud person, I can honestly say I don't know why I'm loud. Maybe as a learned defense mechanism to deal with mansplaining early in my career? Dunno.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, TEEX pays horribly now, so it's a hard sell for most of us to even be interested in teaching there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been teaching a class that makes me feel this way. It's not the fault of the instructors or even the course developers. The changes that it came from the review process with made it really a challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a COVID test on 9/26. Both rapid (which was negative) and PCR. 9 days later, today, they let me know they compromised my PCR sample. I do not recommend GS Labs. They're based in Omaha, but they have expensive popups all over the country. COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. I remember a weird power outage at my old police department that cause all of our key cards to quit working. So we stuffed trash cans in all the doors ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh damn. They fixed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be zero. For reasons. Like this as it turns out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outside?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm right there with you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have work I need to get done, but I keep coming to see the latest dunks on Facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wahahahahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, I know what it says. it says somebody screwed up really, really bad. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There really are no words for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm waiting for my dad to text to complain that this phone is message up again. The evidence of which will be his inability to login to Facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with the sense of foreboding that everybody there is in your actual neighborhood ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switch to NextDoor. Same vibe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not outside the realm of possibility. I even have USB floppy drives just for such an occasion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure we have one around here. Probably in that big box of cables in the basement . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The entire Facebook ecosystem (whatsapp, facebook, instagram)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. Looks like facebook is down now too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This video caused ButtersOK to wander into my office to see what all the meowing was about. He is very concerned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>0500 remote class all week this week. Even the cats were like "WTF you up so early" and went back to sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took my dad to a SeattleKraken game last night. We had front row seats. His first NHL game. He was having a great time. Then this happened. He's still pretty shocked! Thanks SeattleTbirds Community Sports Foundation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had a robust discussion about this last night in our section. And then to our left, somebody held up the Portland Sucks poster, just making our point for us. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, an apology tool? Would this tool be used by Twitter themselves? Maybe to apologize for allowing abuse to happen here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's very exciting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so happy for him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am in this picture!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys. My dad won the 50/50. One of the biggest jackpots I've ever seen in Showare. :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can you tell us what time the doors open? The tickets don't say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Alisha_Beth is advising on a problem. She probably shares some similar thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know a lot of people who do, but also a lot of people who don't. It's all just so dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Ugh. Conversations all week about what happens if Congress fails to do their job. Again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure somebody in my feed knows what time the ShoWareCenter doors open on Saturday for SeattleKraken. The tickets don't say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Butters and Fredrick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of the deal is she must provide protection from the resident felines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: we have a hamster now. It's the biggest hamster I've ever seen. And I'm certain it will bite me at some point. Because hamster are evil little bastards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area emergency management related job with Fred Hutch Cancer Center as a Security Coordinator. EMJobs EMGTwitter emergencymanagement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I don't think any of mine had any degrees. But then we got pulled and were homeschooled starting when I was in 4th grade. So I know for sure there were no qualified teachers after that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. I vividly remember the cartoon image that was trying to describe carbon dating as a circular process. It said something like "the carbon dates the trees and the trees date the carbon". I was in like 6th grade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also married an internet rando! We met on IRC in 1995. We're still married.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my first paid jobs was working for the sheriff's office doing "whatever". We got tasked with hauling all the old cardboard civil defense barrels out of the building rafters. They were all full of supplies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's pretty cool! So many cow lives could potentially be saved with early warning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it's a skilled care facility, they have to have a plan. Their plan will suck. If it's non-skilled, residents may have their own transportation. It all has to start with planning with the facility, not for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've done the senior home evac. A lot of them required specialized transportation due to medical issues. It took many hours. Had to use the cabulance, ambulances, and public transport. You need a really good understanding of the needs of the people in that facility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. They do still have it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the "tsk tsk".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can only imagine your DMs right now ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am dumbfounded by this. In healthcare, fire, EMD, LE. I simply do not understand it. On the flip side, who would have imagined that vaccinations would lead to police reform?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it was a reference to planning and making sure you had cell phones that also had a two-way radio function. I'm sure it was a throwback to our old Verizon phones ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. I thought they had all gone the way of the dodo, but then I saw somebody reference them today and wanted to check before I pointed it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey emgtwitter, are there still cell phones on the market that also incorporate 2-way radios?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an hour+ of my life I'm never getting back. Lots of people are in brain overload though ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a lot of "oh, I didn't know I shouldn't be a host with an iPad or a phone".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because we're all going to be facilitating some global sessions next weekend. And a lot of people have still never used Zoom other than click and stare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. I'm a nearly global Zoom, where we're literally learning to use Zoom. I am D Y I N G right now. They're going over in great detail how to raise hands ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As you were typing, another delay popped. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an ugly delay our of PSC tonight AlaskaAir. Kiddo has to go to school in the morning! Hopefully this time it's actually going to leave instead of another delay.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My cousin just baked chocolate cake in my oven. My house smells edible right now. Mmmmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really appreciate this convo. I work at a university and this came up as part of the tenure process. People need to be their whole selves but are often punished for being so, because of other people's dumb standards.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey EMGTwitter, please consider joining this webinar on Equitable Decision Intelligence. We're making open source models to support equity in decision making. That means we need broad representation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was more annoyed by the people who kept them on for 10 or 20 miles . . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The yard raccoons are not a fan of the light. They usually take a route that avoids tripping the light sensor, but not last night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aren't you supposed to remove yourself from the equation if you're uncomfortable with it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That makes sense. After 20 miles it seems rather pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently the IPA club has an official meme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're on the website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stouts, porters, scotch ales, red ales, goses, sours.. All great. IPA, not so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All IPA is terrible. Even the PNW kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. That said more will role out in 2023.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was useful for the large number of cars that pulled off on the shoulder. For rain. Weirdos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently it's thru April 2022 I think. They have extended it several times now, along with the bonus qualifying miles promo (now through 12/31/21).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does the thing serve a purpose?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was good to see you this week, even if it was via zoom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drove through monster rain in the DC area tonight. Can anyone explain why people turn their hazard lights on here for rain? It's not like they're alerting anybody to the rain. We all know already.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's sort of like charging non-vaccinated people extra for insurance. Some companies do the same for smokers. "Smoker surcharge". Put the costs where they are most likely to be incurred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the people taking it off label are pretty proud of that and will freely state it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Employers already have the option to force vaccines. I suspect this might push more of them to do so since it's cheaper than the employer having to provide weekly testing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sorry.. Weekend rant. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now we have the "prevention" mission area foisted on local govs, which is solely about terrorism. Wtf does a city of 10000 people, with crumbling infrastructure, need to worry about terrorism for??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the stupid shit we spent that money on because it had to tie to terrorism. Think of the mitigation we could have done. As a 911 dispatcher, I did NOT need the gas mask the issued me (which was military surplus).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole conversation resonates. For so many reasons. It's less about panic than it is having a focusing event for which certain liberty infringing politicians were ready for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably. I know a lot of people who pay a membership fee for the air medical providers. And the primary ones here are non-profit. Still but cheap, but maybe some mitigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Somebody just got medical airlifted out of the Gorge campground. Never a good thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, we heard. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not what we wanted to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They advertise it as a "lockout" service. If you every lock yourself out of your house they can cut you a key at the kiosk. But they don't advertise that until after you've shoved your key in and grabbed the image.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They said they delete from local storage and don't transmit them unless asked otherwise, but yeah, I'm not the trusting type.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a response from their customer service already. They don't save them unless asked. I still have SO MANY questions though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a key cut at the grocery store key cutting kiosk. Turns out they took a digital scan of my key, then offered to save it to the cloud. Um, no. And what did they do with the scan they took???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The other possibility is that your state checks on your compliance, since all that preparedness funding passes through them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Among other things, the very short news cycle.

<|startoftext|>It would be cool if someone came up with something free and sustainable. Others have tried, but ultimately found it couldn't be done on goodwill alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe you can work with AEMO or something to come up with an alternative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of them don't require a degree to be certified for instance. Or they require different, or fewer, professional contributions. Or maybe no essay. Some are based solely on training, not on professional activities and experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trainings have gone virtual, increasing access, not limiting it. Be the change you want to see! Volunteer to be on the CEM commission and work from the inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>States often have their own programs that are cheaper and have different reqs than national or international ones. Your friend should look at state certification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having an international certification program requires a lot of backend work that coordinates bodies of knowledge from around the world, to ensure that the right stuff is included for each region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The CEM body of knowledge is based on those same competencies, for the USA version at least. The CEM program itself is certified as well, based on an international standard for certification programs. I chuckle at the idea that we make "extra money" on the program or gain members<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My two ISO certs cost me $100/yr each to maintain, plus whatever CEUs I have to get. CEM ends up being cheaper because it requires less ongoing training and more professional contributions the longer you have it. And it averages to less money per year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not true. You do not have to be a member to be certified. You do not have to go to conferences to be certified. You only have to pay the fee, take the test, and complete the other application requirements. And trust me, ALL certifications offered by a third party make money..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And all of them count toward the certificate or recertification training requirements of most of the professional certifications (CEM, CBCP, CFP, some ISOs, etc).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EFO is more on par with EMI's Advanced or Executive Academies, or the ELP at CHS. None of them are certifications though. They are all a program of study, which leads to a piece of paper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you do survive, you may well have a vastly different quality of life than you did before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What else is there beyond the training? CEM and other professional certs require a lot more than just training. Which is why they have to have review panels and such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other option is for some other entity to create a certification and charge less for it. There have been some attempts, but it's hard to get people to do all the backend work for free, which is what low costs certs would require.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So in the tech industry, you have to pay for your training and the cert costs. In EM, you only have to pay the cert costs. It's much cheaper to be a CEM than many other things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I said tech, I was referring to technical certifications, like CISSP and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not clear on your question exactly. You can get all the training you need for the CEM for free. Your professional contributions are on you though. Most governments CAN accept grants, which is why FEMA was able to pay for many certs last year via IAEM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it NFPA directly or something else? Idle curiousity mostly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW, this is the exact same argument that exists in all of tech. Certs go to those who can afford them. It's a universal thing. IAEM did get a grant to pay for a bunch of local EMs to get them during the pandemic. And tech fundraisers often generate funds to pay for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that a government issued certification for Fire? I know in our state it is. There's a big difference between technical government issued certifications and private ones. The CEM is the cheapest one I have at this point. Tech ones are crazy $$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the point in getting it is whatever you want it to be. Or nothing at all! It's like of like asking why an agency would become EMAP accredited. They found some value in it and went for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As with most professional certifications, the point is to show that you have mastered a body of knowledge. It some markets, it can make you more competitive in the workforce. For some of us, it's a marker of our commitment to the continued professionalization of the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having the media tell their story can actually help generate awareness and aid. Prayers don't t add anything constructive to the response or recovery. They make the prayer giver feel good, but they don't or supplies or boots on the ground. Media coverage is vital to them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah, not anything gentle. Then when I put it in the jar, I squeeze add much liquid out all possible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nope. Slice a head of cabbage thinly. Squish it up with 1.5 Tbs of kosher salt (use your hands). I let mine sit for 15 or 20 minutes at that point. Then cram it in mason jars.

<|startoftext|>I spoke too soon. More flaming shrapnel in my yard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, cops just showed up. Nothing illegal was going on at the time, but I think they got told to quiet down, clean up, and quit blocking the street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear sweet lord. Can't we go to bed already?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The car parked in front of my Dreamcast driveway is leaving, so hopefully they're winding down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are setting off car alarms behind my house..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just went out and turned on the valve for my sprinklers, but of course they won't cost on. The garage way getting pelted with recently flaming shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will be shocked if there aren't craters in the street tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a car parked blocking my driveway and now people are directing traffic around their in-street display.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don't have anyone to send anyway at this point. I guess I'm on fire watch until they're done. Huge flaming chunks falling everywhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's cool! Garage doesn't get sun inside though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The issue is that I didn't drive it for more than two weeks, it has some high electrical drain accessories and no battery cutoff, and I didn't put it on the float charger because I hadn't planned to go so long without driving. But do go on about alternators dude . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dead battery this morning. Rando dude decides to mansplain batteries and alternators to me. I was mostly ignoring him until he said "you need to get your husband to ....". I told him I do my own work, this conversation was over. Hooked up my jump box, started it, drove away. Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit. Kitties and I were enjoying some nice outside time and some jackwagon had to go and explode the world's largest firecracker. Or maybe dynamite. Either way, the peace was broken and kitties went inside with great haste.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So somehow AmericanAir managed to send husband's bag on to Birmingham, but not him. He's still in DFW, waiting on yet another delay. He's been there 24 hours now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm rooting for the Habs because I'm a Carey Price fan. Loved watching him play in the Dub.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too! He will miss his brothers birthday, which was today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally got to an agent, after hours of waiting. Booked on a red eye to Charlotte tonight, then on to Bham in the morning. Arriving 36+ hours late. Good job AmericanAir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So AmericanAir shut their customer service counter last night before helping everyone they stranded in DFW. So husband has to go get in the line again and see if they are going to do anything all even remotely useful. Guessing not ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND AmericanAir WILL NOT give him his bags. They will either send them on to Birmingham if they ever decide to fly there again or they will send them home. So even if he finds another flight, no clothes. AmericanSucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The saga continues. Today's AmericanAir flight to Birmingham is cancelled. He can connect through Florida tomorrow or go direct on Sunday. We're stuck paying for hotel rooms he's not staying in. And he's literally missing half his trip with his family. AmericanSucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Home! After being in Alaska for most of a week, the 73 degrees of my house feels like a sauna. Funny how quick one can acclimate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't want to know . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are the reason several of my masks have tiny chocolate stains on the inside. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was the 17 year old pilot-in-training niece's first AlaskaAir flight 66 milk run. All the way from ANC to SEA (which is hard to book as a lower 48er). She has deemed it rad and says she hopes to pilot it some day when she's an Alaska pilot. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the 4th of July, so probably mostly comforting scared cats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Works for me! Your can even skip the cookies if necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several actually. He just doesn't get to spend them with his family like he was supposed to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow it sounds like. Maybe talk somebody into adding a route to Birmingham?? By Wednesday?! PrettyPlease<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sitting on an AlaskaAir flight eating fresh, warm cookies and drinking Woodford, while my husband is stuck paying for an extra hotel room and wearing dirty clothes because AmericanAir forgot that they need staff to run an airline. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing you know this though, since you don't even bother to reply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently being a Million Miler on American gets you a swift kick in the ass, extra hotel bills, no luggage, and missed family events. You officially suck American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband used the app to confirm a seat in tomorrow's flight, then booked his own hotel room. AmericanAir is not interested in helping him get his bag though, so he's stuck with what he's wearing. He'll probably get charged by the hotel he's supposed to be in tonight too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wish the US had a passenger bill of rights, which obligated airlines to take care of passengers when the airline screws up like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To add insult to injury, AmericanAir now announcing they can't give everybody a hotel room. Up to two hour wait for phone assistance, while also waiting in the actual line for a CSA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband is stuck at DFW. Maybe until Saturday now. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never flew them prior to the buyout, but I did get to fly in the planes after. So fancy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Juneau now, but nothing very exciting to take pictures of! IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish Alaska flew there! I'm on one of their planes right now. They are the best.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nobody flies to Birmingham. But I'm checking..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Husbands is gold for life on AA, but they suck of late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's supposed to be at a family thing. This sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not until tomorrow late afternoon. If they can't get him on that one, it will be Saturday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband is now stranded in DFW courtesy of AmericanAir and their inability to hire enough staff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Find something fun to take during the next year. You're so close! You should take advantage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basic isn't cohort based. It's non-competitive, anybody can take them, and you can mix and match when/where you do each class. AA and EA are competitive with limited seats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm excited to go back to campus. Two weeks from now. Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Application period is April and May every year, so you just missed this year. And yes, they are cohort based.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friday will mark the first EMPP graduation of any kind of campus since March 2020. It's very exciting!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, tomorrow is an FY 20 cohort finally finishing. But still on campus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of this year's cohorts are finishing in-person, starting tomorrow in-fact. FY 22 cohorts will all be live, barring "anything happening".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should not be a real forecast. We are lucky because we have AC. Most people here do not. wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't have them on the west coast. I saw them for the first time as an adult. They are magic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darn it. I only managed to waste 2 minutes of the spammer's time. He was "calling from your TV". I can't even figure out what that scam was supposed to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He has such heart! Won our team a championship with his hand in a splint..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It almost felt like she was proud of it. Like a status symbol. As a kid, it didn't mean a lot to me, but add an adult I understood. I'm the family historian too and can absolutely confirm that our family owned people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My granny used to tell us our family owned slaves but "it was ok because they were treated well". Missing the point entirely.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Simple syrup. I used the wrong measure though. It was 100% on me. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My piano is going to a new home tomorrow. I cleaned out the bench tonight. There was a check stub from a work expense reimbursement from 1993. It will be strange to big have it. I got it in 1986 or 1988 I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sounds nice. Except for the walnut. That works end poorly! That's a surprisingly small amount of bitters too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I already love them! I make them with all sorts of different bitters. I just got too much simple syrup in them this time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've been working on some ideas to help emergency managers better understand technology. My students read the Tech in EM book by John Pine. They read the iaemetc tech recs guide. They used these free resources this term: EMGTwitter 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll start a new thread here in a second under EMGTwitter. Standby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm also working on a set of "what can you take for free" classes to share with EMs who want to up their game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I taught the first iteration of our new tech in EM class this term. Those students learned about cyber threats. One of the reasons I redeveloped the course is the feedback I've gotten from EMs that they don't understand this stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tbh, probably more than 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you! You just saved me a lot of googling about ..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's my backyard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My family are firm believers in modern medicine. We're also firm believers in the idea that you shouldn't have to pay for something you can do yourself. So I have done a minor toe procedure on myself. We'll see how that works out in a couple of days ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This. And electrolysis is out because I'm blond. I was so sad! Fortunately because my eyebrows are blond I also mostly have a invisible unibrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was excited to see this in the mail today from 7eleven. Then I check the calendar. Ummmmmmm . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They just dropped a really great new album too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG OMG OMG. evanescence and Halestorm are coming to ClimateArena!!! Together!!! This is THE show I've been waiting for. Best Monday ever!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. I donate money to the food bank every year so that kids (and their parents) don't go hungry. I volunteer at a free medical clinic so they can get care. Food and medical care should not have to rely upon charity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being on the front end of a large clinic has been very, very cool! I got my vax at a tiny clinic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have gone down a Nextdoor rabbit hole that I will of course regret.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an excellent description. The whole room has this waft of PNW outside now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This scotch is like sipping smoke. Different than anything over had before.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I was promised thunderstorms today. They did not materialize. I am sad..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also so derpy..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just posted the Seattle area transpo options to my Nextdoor neighbors this morning. We're over of the lowest vax percentage zip codes in the county.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>12-15 will hopefully be next week. The challenge for out of towners is second dose. Def reach out to some of the medical partners though, or get the Pride folks to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There also might be an existing location(s) along the route that could be partnered with. I don't know the route though, so hard to lookup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That said, you could reach out to Virginia Mason or Swedish, as they seem to be the medical partners for most of the clinics in Seattle. Swedish partnered with the City and Virginia Mason with the Mariners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody tagged me in your post! It could be feasible, yet the challenge is that we're 67.5% of people in King County 16+ have had their first dose already. And you can walk-in to any clinic or pharmacy and get one now. And unless you have J&J, you need another clinic 3-4 wks ltr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of my friends is graduating from law school. Apparently I'm partly to blame and got this lovely thank you. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, it really depends. I got my first EM job absolutely because I had an MPA/EM degree. The people I eventually hired had degrees in a variety of things and came from a variety of backgrounds/experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's important to recognize too that not everybody goes to school to get a new job. Sometimes they go because they just want to (hence my 83 year old BAS graduate), sometimes because they want to learn about a field they're already in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, but they might want one. There's a school near here that offers a planning degree with a minor in resilience (or something like that). It's a GREAT combo. Those people get jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can drive 30 minutes north and make $120K for a county or a large city. I can drive 30 minutes south and make $60k for similar work. Or stay in my own city and make $80k. NOTE: I'm not actually doing any of the above!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or people who really just needed to join Team Rubicon or something because they want to help people muck out their homes after a flood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or even different agencies in the same basic area. Here in WA, the state pays HORRIBLY. The counties and cities around pay much better. But the state relies upon new grads and those leaving the military. Those people stay a few years and leave for better pay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND a lot of people who get into the programs don't understand what they're getting in to. "It sounded cool" is never a good reason to pick a major.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think it's a small field, especially if we reframe it as "emergency management professionals" instead of "emergency managers". There are a LOT of people doing related work in their own fields.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, also this. Wages are all over the place, many were low to start with, and none are keeping up with the cost of housing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A number of these programs get started because there's a federal report that lumps homeland security in with EM where jobs are concerned. So it counts things like "TSA Officer" in the same category as emergency manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite icHamza quote "have you tried yoga?" That's a perfect example. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Getting everyone to have a service mindset instead of an enforcement one will be a start. Funding mental health services fully needs to happen. Having a zero tolerance on the inside for bad cop behavior has to happen. We all need someone to call though when we need help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I appreciate this thread. Spent much of my career working in LE agencies (not a cop). I've seen first hand some real assholes and people who let them continue. I've also seen the lives saved by cops. People aren't wrong that the system is broken and needs change. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine skipping your free vaccine, paying $150 for a fake card, then getting busted after paying for an expensive trip. I will laugh at those people, while also putting their selfishness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My niece and nephew have clearly figured out that if they find out a reason to be here in the evening, they're getting dinner out of whatever they're working on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Texas councils of government aren't state entities though. That's just a regional system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even when our cities moved to the county system, they lost a LOT of people, who simply didn't reregister. If states had created them first and let everybody tag along, it would have been different. But they didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So apparently this coaching change really, really worked out for them. Holy cow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got to play on the same team as S10Bird AND mPinoe today! Luckily no sports were involved, thus saving me from looking foolish (only dorky in my stylish vest).

<|startoftext|>I see they fixed it. This tweet got me banned, but now I'm not ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The absurd thing is that it's not treating everyone equal. You can do a search for memphis and find plenty of Tweets about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like many. Everything in Kroger's family, the State of Washington unemployment system, some banks, many, many others it looks like. A google search turned up many places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I type crazy fast on it! I much prefer the mechanical keyboards to the soft touch ones. I suspect because I've played piano for years, I'm used to mashing on keys pretty hard.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Same basic thing though. I literally can't get a provider right now and I can't get one of my actual choosing at all. Our healthcare system is stupid and broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My PCP is leaving. Have to find a new one. Want a woman ARNP in my town, in my system, takes my insurance. That's a hard no. So I have to pick an MD, who can't see me until June. So if I get sick between April and June, my PCP will be "urgent care". Which is stupid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This x1000. My parents had to continuously check 4 sites and it was too much. We kids took turns looking as well and my sister finally found them appointments. And if you don't have internet, you're 100% shut out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm all for good security. But right now I'm feeling like a passphrase + Duo is overkill for the thing I now have to setup a passphrase for.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hmph. I found a previously unnoticed transphobe I was following. Now I'm not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish that sentence actually made sense. Pre-Coffee tweeting is a bad idea ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that you refer to Ian as "he", in spite of Ian clearly not being "he" (and clearly noting your bio the they're not a "he") has earned you a block from me as well. Make better choices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has nothing to do with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. I've lost one. I'm out of pockets to check. Found one in my backpack though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe I'm doing it right now even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not with translation, but certainly with visualization!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in a different online group where somebody recently introduced themselves as a 73 trans woman and hacker. They were immediately hailed as an Elder. It was lovely. So I guess the age limit is only on Twitter?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well that's not good. But good on them for trying to keep us all updated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or look at the global map of watches, warnings, and advisories:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HI under a watch. Tune to their Twitter feed for info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it is a third one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Messaging is particularly challenging, since the all clear from the early one was just given in many places, followed very quickly by a "wait, there's another".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang. I know there's a lot of seismic activity in the Kermadec Islands, but a 7.5 and and 8.0 on the same day is a bit much earth. And all of HI, PNW, BC waiting to see if we get a tsunami advisory for this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EMPG was designed to be that, but in some states, it mostly gets hijacked by the states. And in other states, the smallest agencies can't meet the match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is the argument against having a third-party certificate be part of the process. It should have state cert, like police/fire/ems, based on national standards. Third party certs, like CEM (CISSP, CBPC, etc. too) are always going to be expensive cuz sponsor makes $$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You took it out of context. The context was that there should be a federalized process. Which EM is never going to do. I'm getting at that you're reading what you want into what I said, instead of in the context of the conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wholly agree with this. I'm 100% in favor of standards and with each state enforcing those standards. I'm not in favor of a federalized process. That said, those standards also have to be achievable for the EM in remote Alaska.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not say that. Please do not attribute that statement to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why you can be a lawyer in California without going to law school , ABA standards be damned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can have a national standard, but it will still be up to the states to do something with it. They're isn't going to be a nationally enforceable EM standard when there isn't one for anything else. It's still in the states to do something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you're actually saying the same thing I did, but with different words. This is why I don't participate in these discussions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every state has different requirements for fire, police, EMS, and even doctors/nurses. There are some national standards, but each state enforces them in different ways (which is why licenses don't transfer state to state automatically). EM isn't going to do this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yep, that's the problem. There's only one local sushi place and they don't actually offer sushi for delivery. They have other things, but not sushi. Presumably because they too think it should not bounce around in a strangers car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just something about my sushi bouncing around in somebody's car for 30 minutes seems gross.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's the cognitive dissonance response. Your brain understands that bad things can happen. For most people, it also is convinced that they only happen to OTHER people. See Wood & Miller 2020. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really is what allowed us to help them. We watched two other groups arrive and try to dictate what was going to happen. They got run out of town by the survivors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. When we were in Rockport after Harvey, we had a couple of people whose only job was to listen to people's stories. It made a huge difference in building trust. We all listened of course, but we also had people dedicated to it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree with all of this and also recognized that part of the issue is that many orgs only have 1 or 2 people, so there are no entry level positions. Paid internships would be the solution, but $$$. Right now, though tons of potential temp jobs related to COVID.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My original website still more or less exists, in all it's "I learned how to do frames" glory. It also has blinky bits. It's so bad we get offers to buy our domain because people think it's abandoned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By moving from somewhere else! Or spending time in the mountains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a rare thing indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to get my big camera out and have it on standby. I'm sure he'll be back tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He lives next door, but comes here for water. A week or so ago, he buzzed my security cam. That video is on my timeline somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just a regular fountain but I put a trough heater in it. The hummingbird was very appreciative this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alas no, but we did take some manner of steak out of the deep freeze last night, for grilling tonight or tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bird feeders are all filled. Heated bird fountain is topped off. Bring on the snow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I woke up with a migraine. And then took my meds wrong because I had a migraine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally. Washington's biggest grifter finally faces some consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will be available for download shortly on the NWS website ... snow is coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today marks a new day in this era of video call hell. I'm watching a GoTo being rebroadcast via Teams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody in India thinks I'm their Supreme Court Bar Association. So this seems on-brand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For what exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm laughing entirely too hard at this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't think it's publicly announced yet. Won't be open for a couple of weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially since he's kicking off a huge tour. He's the first act booked into our new arena in Seattle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I asked the boss if she was going to try to get you to come back. We had a good laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's exactly what we were talking about. It makes no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sound was really awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't imagine that The Weeknd is going to be thrilled about how his show is sounding in broadcast. Did they forget to hire a sound engineer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The M&Ms commercial with the mansplainer left me giggling for a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week is going to bring a new adventure, as I switch to frontline worker in leadership for a large mass vax clinic. I'm excited to do something more direct than I have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we can see how well those PPE kits are working. Ugh. I agree on the latter though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's incorrect. About 1/3 are healthcare/frontline, at least according to this article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watch much sport, but mostly hockey. There's something like 22k people at this Tampa superspreader event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also yelled that at the TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Florida DGAF about COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I'm going to sit here counting the maskless at the Super Bowl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lines to chew on plastic when he's irritated or stressed. He knows where the ziplock bags are. Sound up at the 15 second mark. LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would think it would be a required design as an official sponsor of the NHL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey discover, when are you going to have the SeattleKraken card available? I'm literally waiting for you to take my money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing they did, but the amount of credit card junk mail I get is extreme. It probably ended up in the recycle bin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh. We hadn't used one of our credit cards in so long that they closed it. In September. We'd had that account for 19 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if you're a Costco member who plans to fly AlaskaAir sometime in the future, you can buy a $500 Alaska gift certificate for $450. That's a good deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My parents successfully registered for COVID vaccines next week. Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friend Kat is in a long-term, ugly battle with COVID. Which means she also can't work. Any goodwill you want to send her way would be very appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So apparently the rest of the NHL season is just the Blues playing the Coyotes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I blew the mind of my first grad school stats prof by using Excel for the whole class.. She had never seen such a thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I was kidding. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you're saying I shouldn't just use Excel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will put money on 99% WTF response on those!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will! You know how they like to read about methods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should have a "WTF even is that" answer too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, mine will be far after that. I just got a chair assigned on Tuesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm also targeting a specific audience instead of "everyone"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When is yours set to drop?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is is. They frown on that being a team sport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we're doing nearly identical things!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, they also didn't advertise price and you had to sign an NDA to get a price.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm working on something similar. Go figure. I've debated UAS. It's not necessarily a direct skill that's needed, but some knowledge would be useful. I'm adding cyber because incident management is key and they need basic understanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I posted this when it first came out! It's like a dispatch console on steroids. And portable!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Success! The sink now drains at roughly the same speed that water can flow into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get very excited about research!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hire people when it comes to that. Old house. If you even look at a pipe wrong something might fall off and it takes 4 trips to Lowe's to get all the various pieces and parts in wierd sizes to put it back together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It still drains, just really slowly. Crossing my fingers, because I don't do plumbing, except to fix toilet guts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the downstairs half bath. Hair unlikely. I did get a cheap plastic snake and fish around, but nada. The regular pipe cleaner made it a little better, so I'm hoping the foam will fix it right up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In exciting homeowner news, the container of foaming Drano arrived today. Had to get it from Amazon because local store doesn't carry. Here's hoping my bathroom drain actually decides to be a real drain again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hard to do when you're the person talking! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody probably heard it! It's a big metal button!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wore my brand new suit jacket for today's virtual meeting. I've never worn it before. The button fell off on the floor. Hmph.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing in the internet today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The grey one was totaled because of the amount of drug paraphernalia in it. Insurance doesn't even try in that case. And the red one wasn't insured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could lead to something very exciting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First you hope you don't get stopped by some other police once you leave. Second, you tell your insurance company. They towed it and secured for insurance and insurance investigator threw it all away. Property, prescriptions, mail, everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They finally got both vehicles back! PascoPoliceDept inexplicably gave them back the grey one FULL of stolen property and drug paraphernalia. KennewickPolice did a full recovery of the red truck today though. And it's repairable. Yay!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no! I met him once, when he spoke at a conference here. What a huge loss for all of us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not in this party of SKC. Still dry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the life I would prefer today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ewww.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fritos! Specifically, the jalapeno ones. That's my official football snack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here too, but that appointment can be via telemedicine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whiteboard would not be a good idea for me. ButtersOK would end up being a giant eraser!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The black short L. Husband got the same one, but the longer version. My only complaint is the CPU holder screws were too long and left little bumps on the surface. But then I got a CPU that was too big for the holder, so it's gone now anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really like my Fully desk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was mostly the swarm of amplifying bots that orbited him, that the humans mistook for other humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's really similar! Ours is taller though. I got it at our local humane society thrift store. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that 73% didn't come from one place. It came from the networks of dis/misinformation, which all got swept out with the trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case there's any doubt what day it is. Caturday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gab, MeWe, Telegram, Snapchat, Facebook, Nextdoor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read a report this past week that said mis/disinformation on the Twitter was down 73% since he who shall not be named left. That's a staggering number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To me it means rich people find really unique ways to waste their money. $3700. For a super ugly caftan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love all the rage tweeting aimed at Costco, which is a clearly dead account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the challenges here with CERT and other volunteer groups is that a large number of their members are in the highest risk categories OR are essential workers in their real lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of our CERT programs are on hiatus here because we can't conduct training. And CERT is just a public education program at the end of the day. Some places use it to create a volunteer pool, but many do not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are plenty of other volunteer groups in communities. CERT is a relative newcomer to the game. All sorts of organized voluteer groups are out there that can help with this stuff. Look at your service clubs for starters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the call centers I helped setup was staffed with employees who would have otherwise been furloughed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mostly MRC and CERT. But it's a small community, so that's a significant number of the population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Paralympics are awesome! And anjalifp is a real Paralympian who has won real medals! And Paralympic hockey is one of my fav things to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have an entire community staffing their vaccination center with volunteer support. Even some of the med staff are volunteers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have done this. My great wish is for Zoom to make it easy to switch between accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the plus side, one sent her phone number and her calendly link in her hate mail. So at least I can block her number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our local one seems to have turned into some wierd dating site. I unsubscribed from everything except gov alerts. I do post prowler vids everytime my cameras catch one in my yard though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two old stalker/trolls have resurfaced in the past week, both via email. Both blocked previously on Twitter, one previously reported to the police. WTF is wrong with people? 2021 is not off to the start I hoped for . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nearly dead center. Spud country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe I could just get on my next Zoom from my phone??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair enough! That's a whole other racket that needs to die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew what I was getting into (more or less), but any opportunity to make parts of it go away would be awesome. If I pay on-schedule, mine will be gone when I'm 68 and hopefully retired. Luckily I'm in a position to pay ahead. But ugh. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Student debt is not low-interest, depending on when you got it and via what programs. If as a younger person you opted for the 20 year repayment at 6.8%, that will haunt you for a very long time. My student debt ranges from 2.18% to 6.5%. My savings accounts from .09 %to .8%. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. My student debt has lumbered along with me all these years. Especially useful if somebody has decided to go learn some new/additional skills along the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there it is! This is probably the ultimate "how it started, how it's going" meme. Thanks BotSentinel<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So not only an insurrectionist, but also intent on committing espionage. My brain hurts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no Matt! So sorry to hear this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just snorted in a semi-public place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But did you pet the doggie??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had one boss who yelled at me. And I will never forget her. She was horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid, vile, crazy, vomitus mass is e-mailing me because I'm adjacent to someone they hate. And my personal e-mail is in somebody's FOIA somewhere. Damnit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm very much for transparent government, but when FOIA requests are used to intimidate and harass people, there should be consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I missed that. Probably just as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So apparently federal policy now is that we DO negotiate with terrorists, as long as they are home grown.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is the devil. I say that as a student and a professor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh. Just noticed that I dropped below 3000 followers. I purged about 30 myself over the past 10 days. Hopefully the rest were bots or people who hate me for being anti-insurrection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And of course that way supposed to say "in an old job". I guess both are accurate though . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm an old job, I had a disagreement with a fed agency about a map we needed. They would not release the digital file. Had my GIS guy make our own based on the paper copy. They were unamused..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Did you see the story out of there over the summer about the black family that tried to go camping? Truly alarming. I think I read it in Wired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it was in wired. Can probably find it there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you see the story over the summer of the black family that tried camping there? Horrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the "whatabouts" are maddening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Sedition Caucus seems to mostly be doubling down. They know what they are doing is wrong. I assume at least some are acting out of fear for their families. This monster they helped create is indeed scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not the usual kind of job I post about, but Mary's Place does great work and Anne is pretty awesome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>20, 21, or 22!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been saying this to my college students for almost a year now. They apologize for not being perfect. I tell them that literally nobody except them cares about their gpa in the long-run. The fact that they finish during ALL THIS will be enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the lack of pain, I think maybe this is a crown that broke. It might be one that's under warranty. That would be something at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Half of one of my teeth fell out while chewing on a French fry. I'm not impressed with anything about 2021 so far. This will be my third pandemic crown . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I started at community college. Now I teach at one. I love them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't reply, but if you see this mx_redmond, community and technical colleges don't care what your former GPA was. And they are far less expensive almost every other option. Many offer 4 year degrees too. Try out a class or two and see what you think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel for that person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a current Sgt at arms? Thought he resigned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally had to cancel one of my credits cards because Azure won't cancel an account that I can no longer login too. It really didn't have to be this complicated ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The whole thing is just ridiculous. They chased the GMC on three different occasions. Weren't interested in even looking for prints, let alone returning all the stolen property. Which my sister now has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should have gotten you 10k qualifying miles last year at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I teach a class on Risk Perception and Risk Communication for GeorgetownEDM. Just published a paper on the cognitive dissonance piece. It's related to disasters, but the premise is the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People's perception of risk is also based on their own experiences and how they think those experiences relate to the current situation, even if it's not the same. Many people still equate COVID to the flu because they were lied to. That's hard to change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Change, not chance. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To affect chance requires long-term messaging to change behavior. Public health has done a great job of long-term behavior change (seat belts, smoking, etc.) bud short term is very hard. Requires the message receiver to perceive benefit to themselves or someone they care about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In part, yes. Cognitive dissonance plays role, where the brain acknowledges that bad things happen, but the default setting is they don't happen to "me", they happen to "you", so you should take some action. We see this in all sorts of places, including infosec, health, disasters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This pisses me off so much. I know the cops don't have the time or resources to look for stolen vehicles, but to threaten the vehicle owner with arrest AND refuse to take known stolen property is pretty ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GMC was recovered, full of stolen property, which PascoPoliceDept refused to take. Sister secured it for insurance investigator. PD also threatened to arrest my sister and nephew if they continued to look for his red truck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems that AWS solved this by keeping a complete backup, which can be subpoened at some point. So everybody can now get whatever they need, for whatever purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially since many of them are essential workers in their daily life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't have enough National Guard to effectively continue COVID response, protect every state capitol, and protect DC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. One city north of me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I helped a little. I'll probably end up regretting it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a crime. Why you defend crime?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Latest batch of insurrectionists wanted by the FBI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not as much as it sounds. Alaska credited me with more than 1/4 of those miles from last year and is doing 1.5x qualifying miles until June. Marriott is crediting half my nights from last year. And my long deployment was in a Marriott.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I am traveling for work this year. There's a better than average chance that I hit the new AlaskaAir 100k status and Marriott Ambassador status thanks to the retention offers they have right now. Marriott Gold for life is definitely happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I teach this, I point out that emergencies happen every day and first responders deal with them. EM as a profession doesn't get involved. Disasters overwhelm local resources. Catastrophes overwhelm regions and countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went to him, he laughed and laughed. Said ignore it for three weeks because that's when their clock to revise W2s ended. Paid him $100. Saved thousands. Always wonder how many people sent them money though. 2/2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny what happens when you get good advice. We had a former employer come after us because they said they overpaid into 401k and they wanted it back or they were going to issue a revised W2. Have a friend who is a tax accountant, certified to try cases in IRS court. 1/2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with this also. Just contemplating all the nuance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My last pre-covid lockdown work trip was to Hawaii the first part of March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And his nomination was withdrawn I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had several until the first of March. Then a couple related to COVID response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But what a time to have this dropped in his lap..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is indeed news. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bizarre continues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot that TripIt keeps travel stats. Oof what a difference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is aweful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I pre-purchase a meal and then get upgraded, do I get a refund on the purchase?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I met this goose yesterday. It was not amused. A story in two photos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a fascinating article on how social distancing was carried out 432 years ago ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which sadly, is very true! Nobody knows how anything works, which is why they think it's all so easy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annnnnd, maybe keep the backup codes someplace secure, for the day your content manager quits and takes the 2FA device with them ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not hacked. Either it has a system glitch or a content manager left a present on the way out the door. And maybe changed the passwords ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, on a very not fake website. It's incrementing. So either a system error or a content manager left a present on the way out the door. Either way, it's both concerning and funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not fake. Still up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ours is luckily easy to remember. Only because when we decided to get married, I called my mom and had her check the family calendar for any open Saturdays in November. There was exactly one and we took it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah, but the method by which they were obtained may not hold up for criminal legal use. Then again I would assume that various alphabet soup agencies had already gotten warrants and started scraping their own data. So it might be a wash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The challenge with the incriminating information, tasty as it is, is that it was illegally obtained. It can be used to get people fired, but it probably can't be used in a criminal legal proceeding. Then again, naming and shaming is quick and probably more effective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mentioned this to someone last night. I keep checking, to see if anyone I know is listed. It worries me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A laughed at the original tweet, but this one has tears rolling down my face. OMG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of no! I think one of my former colleagues had that. They would periodically remove spinal fluid because her body was making too much. Headaches went away! I hope they can make yours go away quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They didn't infiltrate though. They were welcomed work open arms and bad behavior along the way was excused or intentionally overlooked. That's even more damning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Just wow. I don't understand how any conservative can align themselves with the GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying out circleboom right now and it's helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I remember the name, I will let you know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to use a tool that checked for in inactive accounts that I either followed or was followed by. I can't remember off the top of my head what it was though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I try, but sometimes I'm busy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forced about 20 accounts to quit following me this morning. Have more purging to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister-in-law has one. If she can't get somebody to hold her, she will sit on your foot. She'll just keep rotating through feet until either somebody picks her up or her dog buddy lays down and she sleeps on top of him. Such a derpy little thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outstanding thread on censorship, free speech, and how we might want to deal with our tech overlords.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I take heart in the fact that every time I open Twitter, I see that another insurrectionist has been arrested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had managed to put that in a dark corner of my brain. Thanks for dragging it back out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of many, many reasons IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There seems to some confusion tonight about free speech. This handy flow chart should help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine has a glass case with color changing LEDs inside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will admit I've never been to Arkansas, so I have no point of reference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with the turnover rate at roughly 91%, there's zero continuity of government. The vulnerability will continue after the new administration at they work to rebuild staff and acquire knowledge. I hope they can convince some Obama staff to come back, at least for a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were all going, but most were going to stay until the last day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the swamp is finally draining itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So hell really did freeze over . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please never tweet the b word again!! Glad you are all safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Including these people:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate desecration of the flag. Including these ridiculous lines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to guess that most personnel policies don't explicitly prohibit insurrection. Because who would think that needs to be said?! I'm sure there's something to cover it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, nevermind. That was just for show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here we go again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sit down Texas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said pretty much the same thing earlier. Since we can't banish treasonists to another country, the death penalty is the best alternative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, COVID is still a horrible thing that this administration did nothing useful about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That aged as expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a local person who has been a bit of a stalker pain to me and he has a giant punisher on his truck. And he probably has military related PTSD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We saw it in the June protests and now again. And not by the good guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Punch them until they take it off. I HATE that it's been co-opted by evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this now also applies to anyone wearing that damned punisher logo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please call them the terrorists they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, we all know the Hatch Act is no longer enforced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's my new fav senator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To join their seditionist, treasonist, terrorist kin in the great battle apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile at home..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be the day for someone witj an ounce of mortal character to just delete him. They will get fired. And they will be a national hero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watched first hand how mostly peaceful protestors were treated in DC in June. New we're watching white terrorists get a free pass. I want to vomit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asking people politely to stop is not the way to put down an insurrection. You would think we would know this, given the number of other country's insurrections we have meddled in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The states are having trouble tracking this as well, so probably not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TFW when you get a background check call on a friend and are very glad their LinkedIn is active. The things I have forgotten about my friends are vast. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a spreadsheet that has every job I've ever had since I turned 14. I knew I would spend my life filling out background check forms. I wasn't wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not dating, but I really want to try this to see what I end up with!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's quite probable the "something" is BS. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except we shouldn't have gotten it ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the IRS put a stimulus check deposit in our account today. There is zero chance we qualified. It wasn't the full amount, but I can only imagine the sheningans this is going to cause come tax time next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Minor inconvenience . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sharp ceramic knife is sharp. Ouch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not my upgrade! I gifted MVP status to someone and THEY got their first upgrade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the cool things about being an AlaskaAir Gold75K member is gifting MVP status to someone. This year's someone just got their first upgrade to premium and is VERY EXCITED! Thanks Alaska. :) IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They automatically refunded money last year. And they don't have anything lower than we have right now. Have my broker shopping around though to make sure we're not missing out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would add the Social Roots of Risk by Tierney, Disaster Ethics by Zack, Disasters by Design by Miletti.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tribal fireworks stand on the other side of town. They're not legal to shoot off outside of tribal land, but that doesn't really stop anybody . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I care. So much!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And nobody will release that info to my sister or my nephew, because privacy. It seems essentially that the bad guys have more rights than the crime victims. All the kid wants (and needs) is his truck back. Somebody going to jail would just be a bonus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's video of the bad guys at the gas station. They used the credit card to make a collect call to a prison. It would take very little effort for KennewickWA KennewickPolice to follow-up on those things. But NOPE, property crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My nephew has a heart of gold and would have fixed up and given somebody a car if they needed one (he has, on multiple occasions). For him to have had his new-to-him truck taken is the opposite of karma. keprtv KNDUKNDO kappkvew fox41yak TriCityHerald<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the truck was seen late on the 30th in Kennewick and a stolen credit card was swiped yesterday. There's a reward for the truck's recovery. kennewick yakima pasco richland stolencar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to keep my truck on a charger or the battery is dead when I actually want to use it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want a new car. But I can't justify a car payment. And our insurance only gave us a $50 refund for low driving last year. Hoping for better this year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I only put 1733 miles on my truck in 2020. That's definitely some sort of low miles record for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp, we made it through 2020. And there are as many fireworks in the neighborhood as July 4th. Pets are not enjoying 2021 so far . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's one:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kind of want to find a tv channel that is just showing this year end in every time zone, so we can have the satisfaction of watching it end over and over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would take really any hockey at this point, though Kraken hockey will be the best hockey. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think of the CueCat sometimes, as this one hangs from the top of our workbench and I see it every time I'm in the dungeon. Apparently it came to use courtesy of wired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From Big Bang Theory: Leonard: Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California. Sheldon: Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them? I laugh every single time. I didn't even watch that show, but that clip, and those lines, kill me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Concrete is stranger than Big Bottom here in WA..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These kids just got back to work after two weeks of unpaid sick time due to COVID. I'm just so irritated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's already packaged and sitting by the door for UPS pickup. But I hope you put it in the trash this time instead of trying to sell it to yet another person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear amazon, I don't know how this passed your inspection. This is not shipping damage. The actual package was pristine and this cable looks like it was tortured before it died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you live in Tri-Cities, WA or know people who do, please share. My nephew and his girlfriend both had their vehicles stolen last night. Call 911 if you see either vehicle. The truck is pretty distinctive. tricities richland pasco kennewick stolencar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See, and there's the rub. I'm in favor of doxing evil, but against doxing good because evil decides to do it. Bunch of public health workers in Colorado got doxed by the leader of their local GOP group. I want that to not be a thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wish we could make doxing illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though arguably, Liechtenstein would be more interesting ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LinkedIn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, we do with Google. And if you resort to swearing at it, it apologizes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not currently. Next found of funding might bring some addl temp jobs though. I post all the ones I know about on LI (which end up here).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My routine has become too get out of my chair at least every two hours, wander into the kitchen with my giant pink sippy cup and fill it with water. Water bottle just sits there. Sippy cup with straw is what got me to drink my water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>January 21.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know. Hers probably did because it was financed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was just thinking something similar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This year can't end fast enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. My nephew and his girlfriend, who both had COVID and missed two weeks of work (with no sick time) had their cars stolen out of their driveway last night. Please be gone 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, please do not do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. I didn't realize it was supposed to be a back channel. My bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I often have 40+ crows in my yard. I have fresh thawed water for them in the winter, plus peanuts. And they hilariously try to eat from the bird feeders as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This year needs to end. Just found out a friend's spouse died unexpectedly. Another friend is about to lose a parent. Another friend has long-term COVID and is having to crowdfund their life. Everything about this is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This adventure of finding food that Butters likes, that is listed on his "ok to eat list" and hopefully that also smol cat likes, has turned out to be a real boon for the crows and the yard opossum. Cats won't eat it? Goes in the crow feeding spot. 6 crows feasting right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should definitely follow my actual cat ButtersOK then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. And the day Naomi followed me back I nearly died. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love him!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my friend Kat. I've known her since 1997. She has COVID, and not the kind that goes away quickly. After her third trip to the hospital, she could use some help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took a screen shot and texted it. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could also happen on Denver. I know this for fact. Once they are no longer remote that is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey FredMeyerStores kroger Janis at your Auburn WA store says this coupon won't work because your app has been hacked. Says it's fraudulent and her explanation is that you've been hacked. Please advise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the great mysteries of Auburn! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sent New Years cards. I just happened to accidentally get them all sent before Christmas.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The joys of Christmas, day 2. Featuring ButtersOK and a gift bag.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Finally got to the right time of day to try out my Christmas present.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, Butters approves of all of this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone sent a catnip mat ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He has been. For a while he was sacked on on a Christmas sock, chewing on a bow. Right now, I can hear him in there tromping through wrapping paper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit. But that also likely saved lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone sent a catnip mat for the cats. They approve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Merry Christmas from the house of nerds and cats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is normal. Even when we're out of town (which we're not this year). I do not try to fight this system. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. Its like telling people I live in Seattle when I actually live in the burbs. It only matters when talking to other people who are "from Seattle" though. I guess the same is true about the Birm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In his own version of a Christmas tradition, my husband is out shopping for gifts right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I have fam in Helena!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. One more reason to despise GoDaddy. How horrible. I know jobs are scarce right now, but I hope all of the people who work here are able to abandon ship and go work for a less disgusting company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And don't forget this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I printed these to go with holiday cards this year. After about the 20th trip down and up the basement stairs, I realized that RealSexyCyborg's 3Dprinter with the conveyer belt has risen to the "need" list if I ever do this again! [note, early prototype. final was less ugly]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are better sized for airplane coffee cups. This is precarious!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We also love cats. And we plan to spend 2022 napping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what's the going rate for a Presidential pardon this week? Or does it adjust by day? Or maybe by type of crime?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm secretly hoping they were allergic to soy and have severe gastrointestinal distress all day ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally missed that this had happened and I'm very happy for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hands down the strangest sponsored ad I've ever gotten on insta.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I had some United flights, which is where I remember how much I love them. I bought a variety pack at the beginning of the pandemic. Mmmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the were staggering the timing of the two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want it noted that one of my longest standing friends on the planet sent me Stroopwafels in lieu of a holiday card. This is how you know your friends care!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh, I have a new follow from someone in the Czech republic. Maybe he can go to Plze and get me a case of Master's Dark and ship it ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. And another one bites the dust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy cow. House down the street was on the market for a whopping 4 days before it sold. It last sold in 2017 for $475k. List price this time was $585. Guessing they got more since it went so fast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've heard from several people who have lost their accounts recently. Glad you're back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, because many government entities show up this way. And some of them call me. And pay me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister and I have been trading the same fruitcake back and forth since 1996, after I accidentally gave it to her as a wedding gift. We find ways to hide it or otherwise surprise the other with it. It's currently hanging in my house as a cat toy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your eyes will thank you when you get it dialed in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, that seems to be about the standard unless you ask for something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the exact convo to have with the doc. For some reason, they write them for way closer distances. If they write for 3, it will be even better when you're closer. Mine work great on desktop and make my eyes very happy on laptop. I'm opinionated about glasses! 43 years exp!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Measure. It makes a huge difference. My computer glasses are measured. My everything else glasses are not. The difference is remarkable. And if they blow you off, go elsewhere. Doc needs to write the scrip based on the distance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you measure from your nose to the screen and have them made for that distance? That can be a key to success. Reading and computer glasses are not the same thing. Different focal points. You might like progressives, which are cheap at Costco.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to be tired. And will likely be found napping. Hopefully somewhere warm and sunny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turn around, don't drown people. TurnAroundDontDrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait until they have a bonfire on the White House lawn on January 21 to burn all these shitty EOs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I gift somebody MVP status (via my 75k gift thing) before the end of the year, is it valid until the end of 2021?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As opposed to meeting them where, exactly??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That kind of stuff is just infuriating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems like something they should handle via telemedicine or something too, given there's a pandemic on and all. Why make me go be around potentially sick people, just to get my meds refilled?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate our healthcare system so much. Need to refill a standard med that expires in 10 days. Them: DENIED. You have to have an appointment first. Also them: our first available appt is in 32 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will send mouth watering photos. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swing through Seattle for smoked mac n cheese, roasted Brussels sprouts, smoked [brisket/pork/turkey/whatever is in the fridge], and creme brulee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know! All the gifts were amazing. We think it might be our new family tradition. Every single gift was clearly designed for the person who got it..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Secret Santa made me this. It's all hand beaded. And that yellow design on each point? That's a beaded representation of ButtersOK's butt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And day 12 brought pneumonia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, Zoom family Christmas was a success. Secret Santa and all gifts had to be made by sender. There was a knife, a booze tree (made from welded horseshoes), 3D printed objects, woodworking, knitted things, beaded things, sewed things, and more! We're a pretty creative bunch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those are very cute. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like a cat toy if you're a cat!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those would likely be misconstrued as cat toys and chaos would ensue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh god. That sounds worse than the peanut butter bourbon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it's Google, so that's all you can ever find. We're going to have another go at account recovery from a real computer after the police call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Google. Helping somebody whose gmail was compromised and who is now receiving death threats via text from the person who did it. And Google's official advice is "maybe just make a new account". And yes, police are being looped in now ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Santa on a test run?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good news is that though the rest of his family got it, they area all very much on the mend. Two have even passed through the quarantine stated, moved back to their own home, and gone back to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I can't explain are the root beer schnapps. Those showed very poor choice on my part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a bottle of creme de menthe because I love grasshoppers! I can't remember the last time I had one, but knowing I could if I wanted is what counts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My little Christmas tree makes me happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread made my day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it was! You were my hero. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have. Don't know if they have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my family members who has COVID has had a fever now for 11 straight days. They are not well. Not sick enough for the hospital, but still very sick. Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of the above.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the kind of rabbit hole I like! Too much sometimes. Grades are due tonight though .... :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can probably find an open source front end for it, so that all you have to do is right reports. I absolutely have to grade some papers right now, but I'm going to take a look when I'm done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind of server? Windows or Linux? This sounds like a great case for MySQL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm very passionate about using databases when relational data is involved. I was the only person at my last real job who got to keep my Access database, after IT wasted several months trying to turn it into a SharePoint. I actually got to say "I told you so". :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pulling the data from it requires a minimal amount of coding. Is there a common location all these users have access to (intranet maybe)? What are you options for installation? Where does the Excel file live now? Can a database live there too? Or at least the front end access?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the beautiful things about building a database is that it doesn't really require coding. Sketch it out on paper, with the fields you want and how they related to each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you just use Access (if you have Excel, you might have Access included in that subscription)? Otherwise a MySQL install works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since it's a valid charge. I suppose I could just cancel that credit card. But that won't stop charges from accruing. This is some fresh new hell ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Never setup an Azure account using a federated login that then gets deleted with no notice. It is very, very hard to delete an Azure instance that you can't login to.

<|startoftext|>Just loaded a 22 hour print job into the 3D printer. This is going to be epic. Remains to be seen which ended of the epic scale we land on though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no! They had good food, but more importantly, they did good in the community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, iterative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NEMAA instructors mostly write the material at this point, so depending on when you took it, there will be some potential big differences. That's one of the few programs that's highly iterative. Other material takes a LONG time to update.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are good instructor notes for a lot of the courses, which just require the instructor to know the material. But the states choose their own instructors. There's often a very different set of requirements at the state vs EMI level for instructors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, something like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's good too, but we need to hit the basics first!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See my tweets from yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First rule of OSINT: if the subject discovers that you're investigating them, you've probably failed. Don't follow them on Twitter or connect with them on LinkedIn, or even view their LI profile from a non-private LI account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have two. A small delta that is in need of repairs and a larger dual extruder. I've done some fun stuff with both, but it's not something I've had a lot of time to deal with of late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing that don't tell your about 3D printing is the number of blood sacrifices required. Three of those knuckles have been required this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I know that GovTechSG is sponsoring a CTF and that my Twitter handle is in an APK that was shared with participants. The target isn't actually me. osint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Valid point. It was so lovely there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm suddenly getting a bunch of follows and LinkedIn requests from accounts in Singapore. Did somebody write my info on a bathroom stall??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for this gift!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate Facebook . They won't recognize my 501(c)3 as a charity because they want a document from 3 years ago to have been issued in the last 6 months. And now they rejected our ad, with no explanation. We're selling a puzzle for pete's sake, not body parts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The rest of the afternoon has been cancelled in favor of snuggles and purrs with ButtersOK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We hit a limit on text chat today, or at least came very close. And we weren't even chatting that much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was that by chance a meeting I was involved with??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adobe Connect is the scourge of the earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a stats nerd. I get the numbers. The concerning thing is that we're 7% higher than other surrounding cities and something like 20% higher than the rich cities in this county. Income and healthcare access disparities are very real. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The positive COVID rate in my city over the last 14 days is 30%. I suppose that will likely go up as the consequences of Thanksgiving gatherings start to be seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bigger issue seems to be that FDEM said they were hacked. Maybe the media should have pushed back on that, but it makes FDEM look incompetent either way. Better if they had just said they didn't know yet. Hacked implies all their info is insecure and their security sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did a massive closet purge and gave a TON of clothes and some shoes away on Buy Nothing. I have another purge to finish. Part of old me will be back, but with a new wardrobe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That depends on where you're at. I've seen plenty of unionized EM folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm betting either current user or former user whose credentials weren't removed. The term "hack" gets used a lot when "we had crappy polices" is the better phrase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, from the description it's something like Everbridge or CodeRed. You can't create lists in non-opt-in services. Given the ESF chosen, I would bet on unauthorized use, not a hack. And they probably already know whose credentials were used.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This made me laugh! I have raccoons who live here, but we don't see them much. They know how to navigate the yard without tripping the security lights. And luckily they do not go on my roof!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could work though if the shot goes in your ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. I'm very excited about having an owl out there. I want it to stick around, but I'm sure it's just passing through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The owl started hooting again. about about 3AM, which coincides with a security video of the asshole cat doing zoomies in the backyard. Maybe the owl will encourage the cat to go live elsewhere! There's also a bird carcass under the tree this morning, so owl has dined here. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I probably can't adequately describe how excited I am about this! I stood out in the dark and listened to it for a while. I hope it sticks around until morning for photos. I've never gotten pictures of a Barred Owl before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've lived here 15 years and this is the first time I've ever heard an owl here. It's camped out in the neighbor's giant tree. I can't see it, but can certainly hear it! owls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a difference between being "not racist" and being actively anti-racist. From my perspective, it's the difference between assuming everything is fine and assuming we can do better and going forward from that perspective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was no give and take. Student never talked to me, went over my head, then rage quit the program. The book though is Ethics of Disaster by Naomi Zack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny you mention that. I was discussing this with someone earlier today and specifically noted the cult-like features of some of this thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see that as a piece of it. Lack of exposure to a wide variety of thoughts and ideas contributes. We're actively working on being an anti-racist college and that does cause some heads to explode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see it as two separate issues. The inability to think critically is separate from the echo chamber part, but they are often seen together. Correlation, not causation and all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, public college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've taught for 18 years and it has gotten worse, partly because it's so easy to find your echo chamber and believe it represents the entirety of the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I teach college. At the undergrad level, the lack of ability to apply critical thinking and discern fact from fiction is very real. I got absolutely lambasted by a student because I forced them to read a horrible liberal book. It was a book on ethics. Basic ethics. Not political.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I have no idea how that is comfortable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he quickly forgave me for poking his ear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After three days of trying, I finally got a successful blood sample from ButtersOK for his new glucose meter. And for the first time in at least two months, his sugars are where they're supposed to be. Yay!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They rightfully said "our house will be fine", but had never considered the infrastructure that supports their existence. Camping out for a few days with no power sounded like an adventure. Pooping in a bucket did not. They evacuated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The choices we give them should be designed to help them make the right decision. We focus on leave or die, but we don't talk enough about post-disaster living. "how long are you and the kids prepared to poop in a bucket" turned out to be highly effective for a loved one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The key to getting people to take action though if to ask them to do one simple thing that is helpful to them or someone/something they love. The SSN thing does nothing to help them. It's not grounded in research, but rather in arrogance. It lacks empathy, which is key.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe we can keep Krebs and lose Chad. That would be a win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's some sort of pre-installed thing on our smart tv I guess..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow our TV has CBC. I am delighted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The interesting thing is that people don't understand that the delete button doesn't actually remove things forever. Not Twitter, not e-mail, nothing. It's always somewhere ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully the intern grabbed the data download before hitting the delete button ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more reason to strongly dislike Facebook. They won't recognize our small non-profit as a non-profit because we're covered under a group exemption, the letter for which was issued more than 6 months ago. Their process to get to this point has taken more than 6 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's working now. And that is aweful. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I know any medical office managers who want to relocate north? Far, far north?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know you but I think it's hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too! She was very happy to have a shop at her new house to put all her outdoor things into. She said it was a lot better than having to tie everything down to their apartment patio! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Master of chaos is pretty much what I do. Maybe I'll update my business card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, he apologized. but also ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's going to complicate things.. Make places will be unable to store vaccine even if it can get to them..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One month into owning her first home, my sister is running around battening down the hatches for a hurricane. Go figure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not the president you're looking for. This also makes me point that nobody in India checks to see who they are tagging. That's three today . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the second time today, I AM NOT THE SUPREME COURT BAR ASSOCIATION of India. Does nobody in India check to see who they are tagging???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unclear. But you know you're probably making bad choices when both the anti-semitism cow and the Auschwitz Museum have thoughts to share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems to capture them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was not the one I expected. There was another about striped uniforms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He seems to have deleted it. But the interwebs never forget to. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going out for sushi. And for karaoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was, but it doesn't work well. It shows everybody shadow banned all the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for Sec Pompous to go . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still only have about 5 bucks. Please quit tagging me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really, again????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because I've used this name since 1988. I'm not changing it because people are too lazy to look at see who they're tagging. Plus, what other photo would I have? Is the red haired American woman photo not a dead giveaway??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean seriously. How hard is it to figure out that the red headed woman wearing a face covering isn't a supreme court justice in India? Or do you just never, ever bother to look and see who you're tagging?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I'm going to start charging for every time somebody tags me in a post about the Indian Supreme Court Bar Association.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got maybe 5 bucks. Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're our hero!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to go to bed, but I'm currently playing the role of lap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seconded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went down the Walden path. I liked my professors, but my dissertation chair sucked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took no loans until I tried to get my PhD. I made bad choices. And they were happy to let me continue to make them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I pay mine on schedule, they will end when I'm 67 years old. I'll finish paying them with social security I guess. I've managed to pay off several of them early and I hope that continues, but if not, 67 it is. And F that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I even went back to see if I had taken photos of the inside. Sadly, I did not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably, I no longer remember!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is one of my favs. Didn't notice the sign the first time I took it. Then I got three more because it made me laugh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not sure which is better: Bovine Twitter (@DevinCow, AntisemitismCow, cDc_Pulpit) or Canine Twitter (@dog_rates IvePetThatDog CanYouPetTheDog). They have entirely different purposes, but I find them all lovely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's going to be a lot of cuts here though, to police and everything else. The budget implications of COVID are no joke. That one though was so stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They changed their mind and tried to bring her back. She was done with their shenanigans. On the plus side, all that kerfuffle caused EM to move out of SPD and get a cabinet position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Seattle chief quit though when the city council voted to make her the lowest paid city department head. She noped right out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The county was a ballot measure to change the county charter back to the way it used to be. Sheriff here used to be appointed, about 20 years ago voters changed it to elected, now they've changed it back. So not directly..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got home from Denver to this. I adore my IAEMETC friends, but none of them live with me! Part of me wonders if this is a prank from beyond the grave by find_doc. EOC_Designer The_MattGreen MaryJoFly echelon0911 schuback Jdlazo chayne_s PJperez19 IAEMSTRONG IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am bummed that my county has voted to quit electing our Sheriff. The top two law enforcement positions in our county were held by a black woman and a lesbian woman respectively. Both will be gone. In what is supposed to a progressive county. Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grrrrr. E-mail address at domain A is somehow autoforwarding to me at domain B. I'm in no way associated with domain A. They can't find that address in AD. And yet, here we are. And I'm having to cut and paste e-mail headers to the person who is supposed to be fixing it. monday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed yes. Though I would not be surprised to learn that he won't go..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they have a distinct advantage of having these keys to this particular one. And probably an "inside man" or 10 ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus there are two German Shepherds moving in. I suspect the soon-to-be-former occupant does like doggos at all, especially ones who might be trying to encourage him to leave. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the Secret Service knows how to escort people to the door . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cheat and use battery operated candles with essential oil thingies in them. Because the big dumb cat with the giant puffy tail will catch himself on fire otherwise ... :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A dead guy won a race in the Dakotas. Died of COVID during the election. With the rising rates of the virus, it is plausible that some people died after sending in their vote. Not 600k, but more than usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Tina Turner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonnie Raitt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Got up this morning to find my desktop computer dead. The Surface is now doing temporary duty as a desktop. It can only drive one of my two monitors though. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several spoof accounts popped up today.. This a pretty funny one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, if we get to choose, I would have a rotation of all the above, and adding a Middle Eastern truck. Best hummus I ever had was from a street vendor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sad that we never got the promised taco truck on our corner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any amount of Gritty is odd. Mostly loveable, but odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The place kind of looked closed. So there might be a C there and they were trespassing . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have to think that whoever took that phone call might have thought it odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this point, I really need to hear the actual story of how Rudy ended up speaking outside the landscape shop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoever was responsible for the landscape shop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope the advisors who wrote that don't plan to ever work again ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My husband is not on-call this weekend. And yet I hear the ring of doom coming from upstairs. That's probably not a good sign ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I giggle every time I read some version of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like a photo of the new Gritty please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mostly just roll my eyes. Between them and the South Carolina Broadcasters Association, I get some interesting mentions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to inflict harm on whomever decided that doing a maintenance window for a pandemic call center, during the hours the center is open, was a good idea. Seriously back end people, see who's using your systems and plan around that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go check out this thread though:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I probably just insulted boats by saying they honk. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Seattle people are just standing outside yelling, cheering, banging on pots and pans, shooting off fireworks, etc. The Harbor is a mass of honking. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*sigh* I have nothing to do with any of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether he concedes or not, Secret Service still escorts him to the door when his term is up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was awesome. Also, nice cat cameo. And it just hung there off screen, tail flicking in judgement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I gave my company a name and now I always have something to list. If they really want to know, they can creep my LI and just be confused ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Stats nerd in his happy place. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Wow. Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is hands down the weirdest promoted tweet I've ever been presented with. I suspect somebody is going to be really surprised by their credit card bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has he even slept?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stats nerd in me has loved the last 48 hours. But then I remember everything that rides on these stats. And it's nearly overwhelming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it looks like my expensive new merrelloutside hiking shoes that I started wearing the end of June had only a 60 day warranty. They broke last week. I expected more than 4 months from them. Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You heard about the first time around right? Where they terminated my contract via e-mail at 9 PM on a Tuesday??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing a lot more consulting hopefully. And FEMA classes will be back next year and I already have 15 weeks dedicate to them I think!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Last formal meeting today with the 16 cities, 1 tribe, and 1 island I support. We thought 3 months ago was it, and that was much harder, since it wasn't my choice.

<|startoftext|>Thanks for having me!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So this is your fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, would much rather be playing a game than doing this in real life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's crazy that they don't let you. As a small business owner, my life revolves around tracking and billing. I use Harvest btw. Can you just sneak it on to your phone and use it anyway??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If I could do it more of a conversation style with one or two other people, like a live podcast almost, would be better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one I did had a moderator. But nobody interacted at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. I did one. I did not enjoy it. I have no idea if the audience did or not. It sucked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may have passed legal muster, but if there are any credible public affairs people left, they just died a little.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not come here to find a third party's misconfigured web server. But alas, here at are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to a new restaurant owner!! Been on the receiving end of that. I even updated their Google restaurant listing while I waited for my food. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looking for lunch in Denver today I stumbled across Pita Fresh. Turns out it was their soft opening and I was their first customer. I scared them a little I think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may not go down as one of my better life choices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have made this the centerpiece of every talk I do. Fix polices from being punitive to being rewarding. I suggested to a company that they change their "challenge people for not wearing a badge" policy to reward who actually do. A stack of Starbucks cards later, they did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I only had a carry-on. Otherwise it would not have worked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Butters had follow-up bloodwork today. His blood sugar was 49. Not good. Too much insulin.

<|startoftext|>UPDATE: Buttersok blood sugar went from over 600 last night (they don't know how much over because their machine only goes to 600), to 160 this morning, with 4 units of insulin.

<|startoftext|>Thanks. This sucks. They're down a vet, the phone is going to voicemail, and I can't go visit him because of COVID.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not arthritis. Diabetic emergency. Sky high blood sugar. The weak legs are probably a neurological symptom of this. This day sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and that's awesome! Are you doing a virtual one this year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. But ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, it has to be open enough for players to get to their teams. Which it isn't right now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If we're talking about official written positions by the parties, yes. If we're talking about the way in which they actual operating, probably not. Actions speak louder than words ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. I had one of those cases in my EOC. It was in fact old and Canadian. It contained an AM transmitter that I could broadcast on city-wide via VHF as long as somebody hauled it up a hill. It was . . . probably not legal. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's chili under there, I promise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's part of basic civics education in my book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm happy to introduce them to an entire generation! I leave out the part about having to adjust the rabbit ears . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took the last of the tomatoes my dad brought me and roasted them. They are now in the instant pot being turned into chili. We're definitely in the hardy soups and stews season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my students noted this term that they never learned this in high school, or anywhere else, until right now. And most students end up with an aha moment of some sort. How our middle and high schools failing at this? It boggles my mind. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've really come to realize that part of our issue as a country is our lack of basic civics education. I teach a college senior level course on law and policy. I include a refresher on the three branches of government (complete with Schoolhouse Rock vid). 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh. The direct amazon packages. Yeah, don't care about those. I was thinking "from Amazon and shipped by UPS or FedEx"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's handy when I have to sign for something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since Twitter lets you follow hashtags now, I follow CatsOfTwitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leadership is about people. Management is about stuff (time, money, tangible resources). I can manage a fleet of vehicles, but I can't lead it. I can try to manage people, but they'll function better if I lead them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhh, that makes sense. A rock farm, aka gravel quarry. They blow up rocks to make smaller rocks. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's unusual. An mildly concerning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah, you caused a teachable moment! People make their own choices about what they answer for security questions and what information they put online. They just need to make sure those are informed choices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is near and dear to me. Not only do I love music, but my brother and his girlfriend work in the industry and they have a brand new baby girl to raise. Need to help the venues survive until they can open again. KeepMusicLiveWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure. It was an exciting way to start the morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never apologize for security! We have to weave it into everyday things to make it relevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mother's maiden name is a really good one to lie about and track the answer. I hate the places even use it at all..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's rolling pretty good here in the valley.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thunder is making the house shake.. This is a very exciting morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhhhh. Lightning and thunder!! WaWx AuburnWa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or remember to lie in your security questions and track the answer in a password manager. Option A (not sharing) is easier. I know that first car is on at least one of my accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I didn't have any doubt they were. Every sign pointed to badness. And the signs were all correct ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what happened to one of our guys. He hair was SUPER CURLY and it made him look really young. They buzzed it off and I realized he was 10 years older than I had thought. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we were deployed, somebody brought clippers and one of the guys became the barber for the other guys. I threatened bodily harm if they got close to me with those things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the beauty of screen shots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have. My hair stylist is in a very small shop. She's there by herself on the days assigned to her. There's no overlap of customers. And I'm hoping to help her stay in business. I had to have a root canal in March too. And just finally got the crown fitting done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister-in-law have already decided that as soon as pandemic is over and the Canadian border is open, we're taking our niece for pastries here. Plus we need to go Costco there ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally get to do the much delayed talk to middle and highschool kids and their parents about staying safe online. Good books to recommend to them for reading? I already have two of violetblue's Smart Girls Guide to Privacy to give away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jump to the 40 second mark for a feature I call Bowling For Crows, courtesy of a squirrel..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the time of day when crow friends come to visit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm also showing as shadowbanned. Which makes zero sense. Happened about a month ago too, when Twitter Analytics was broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's all sorts of wacky stuff going on. I suddenly found myself blocked by a really great writer, after having never interacted with him. Did a search found another who had the same issue. Unblocked now. Had a post lose 5k impressions overnight. WTH?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the back piece, I gave her a wine bottle, a classic painting, a seismograph image, and a couple of photos to work from. For the leg piece, I gave the artist a piece of sheet music and a photo of my fav dress. They were both amazing artists!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both of mine took a lot of thought and deliberation on my part, then working with an artist to actually figure out what it was going to be. Had to find the right artist both times. The back piece is every disaster I had lived or worked at the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is my leg. That is one of our baby yard squirrels last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peanuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS. I had a root canal in March, early in the pandemic. You definitely do not want to do that. Just finally got all the prep done for the crown last week. Fillings are quicker and way cheaper ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit. I'm sorry. People are sometimes horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so awesome! I just my dad the link so he can join. It would give his metal detectors more purpose in life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhh. Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's trippy for the helo too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I saw that. What's the elevation there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not profitable for them to have to replace shitty lines, but odds are their licensing agreement requires them to actually provide they service reliably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those are the best dissertation acknowledgments I've ever read!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While you're on hold, be sure to fill out the complaint with the utilities commission in the proper state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes!! Also, that must have taken a LOT of rope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes me glad that our home has been entirely purged of their services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That looks like an exciting road!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the plus side, it got some people banned from the group. Buy Nothing is not down with doxxing. The gem was the "I let my intact tom cat run free because neutering him would be cruel". She should have to pay kitten support for the 1000s she's probably responsible for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also got doxxed for noting on a community board that I was going to catch other people's cats in my yard and turn them in to the Humane Society for spay/neuter/chipping and return. The cat freedom people are intense ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. I always am so sad for cats that get hit by cars, eaten by predators, etc. when it didn't have to happen. I do let my cats out in the yard with me under supervision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A crow came up and banged on my home office window. I'm not sure if it was trying to attack a reflection or asking for treats. But I threw some peanuts out there just to make sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is awesome! Though my husband and I didn't meet at defcon, DC 4 was our first trip together, before we were married.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah, I grade what they turn in. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same, BUT I was unfollowed (and forced to unfollow) someone due to this. No loss. But the effort it took them to block me, then unblock me just so I could no longer follow their locked account is pretty telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds of Silence by Disturbed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I lost 5k+ impressions on a single post overnight during that time, so I think Twitter did something that went awry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for being an intermediary Peter! And thanks for the unblock Cory. I started digging to see if there was maybe some shared block list I had been added. I narrowed down the dates to 10/6-8, which is when I think it happened, and there was his post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go vote for my cat and help out one of my favorite local charities!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW, the best tip I ever got for scooping squash is to use an ice cream scoop, especially if it has the sort of pointed end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So weirdly, Fred Meyers (aka Kroger) has a new option to pay with their app. BUT you have to swipe it before the checker starts the checkout process. You don't swipe before you enter the store, but you do have to pay before they ring anything up. Equally bizarre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you ever get any sort of response from TwitterSupport about how you ended up being blocked? I suddenly find myself being blocked by Cory as well, and it's likely he doesn't even know I exist. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! The first CAD system I ever used was New World, on an AS400. Your thread brought back memories!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially from one of my college students ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you set a meeting with me for 10:15 on a Sunday morning, you better show up ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was actually ask about the kiddos today, them I observed the arrival of the drama llama and didn't. So I'm very glad to see this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was it one of the old AS400 systems??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing I got added to somebody's block list on October 7 or 8 and that he must subscribe to it. Things are coming in to focus ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's unexpected. WTF did I do to even grab doctorow's attention, let alone get blocked by him??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My husband has been known to do that in hotels. I always wonder if anybody ever notices and "fixes" it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is outstanding reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Specifically, I have this one:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have one of the ambientweather all-in-one units.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The trees mess with my wind speed accuracy, but not the rain! I need to go back and clean the garage gutters. They are not ready for fall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm picturing Underoos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got up on the roof. Dug a fir needle out of the rain gauge. Problem appears to be solved ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suspect there's also the idea of "if we ask, we'll have to do something and we have no resources left, including money".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can only locally manage to local capacity. Local capacity was mostly shot 6 months ago. There's nothing left in the tanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People would crap their pants if a bear showed up here. I know they are occasionally within a mile of here, but the general suburban public is mostly oblivious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh. I just saw a fox run past the house and down the street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't checked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looks like I need to do a tiny bit of clean up on this. Some non-disaster tracks were added. Possibly by the artist themselves. Which amuses me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My work-in-progress angry playlist:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Tech Ladies official playlist:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My collaborative Disaster Tracks playlist:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, also, moo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This made my morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"my rain gauge". Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest rain event of the season going on. My rain is like "nope, nothing going on". There's probably debris in it. Or worse yet, a spider. So now I gotta climb up on the garage roof in the rain. Or see if the nephew will do it for $50.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It came back on in the 7 hours it took you to respond, do there's not much you can help with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the glorious sound of rain..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome back. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Replied. And it only went to you. It was doing it the other way for a while though,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. comcastbusiness is down. ETA to repair is 7 hours from now. That's a long time, especially when both home occupants work from home. And still have shit to do today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watched somebody have a social media meltdown because people on an airplane were allowed to drink water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Prednisone. I'm sorry. That shit makes me angry and mean. And induces panic attacks. I'm glad it's there to keep you alive, but I'm sorry you have to take it. Yell all you need!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The higher end setups don't artifact nearly as much as the consumer stuff does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would think they have better tech than zoom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's legit in that it's him, but it very much appears to be a green screen and not the actual yard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to mention it's a green screen . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something is up with twitter analytics again. Somehow I had a post that lost 5000 impressions. That's not how impressions work ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this build on Miletti's work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've not been paying attention, but this can only mean you bought a new-to-you house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, that number is way low. Doesn't track with any current data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most people now will career change at least 4 times in their life. That's roughly once per decade of their working life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Screamin' Sicilian supreme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just watched all the places of my youth burn in Oregon. For the first time in recorded history. Yes, climate change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, special doohickey.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You could park in my driveway for a few days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>House of nerd now has perfectly clear ice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what? This is amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$800/month does not cover the cost of childcare if mom is working. Let alone anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The excellent news you've all been waiting for!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not false.. He didn't have to go on a drive while admitted to the hospital. They are doing their job and he acted recklessly toward them. He could have made choices that didn't put them in the way of additional harm. He treated them like he treated the rest of us: without care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it's very selfish to intentionally put them in harm's way when you can make other choices. They signed up to protect him, not to be intentionally harmed by him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have some of the best internet friends. That is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HVAC repair guy is here. ButtersOK is MOBBING him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonus: I got it at Costco. Also, my rums have their own place to hang out..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tasty. And apparently DethVeggie recommends it with boozie cherries, which I have in my fridge. Plan to try it that way tonight..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can also confirm. And this is just the bourbon . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo, hockey nerds. This survey needs you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have had this discussion. In classes. "What kinds of severe weather do you think of?" "Wind, rain, earthquakes, snow". Me: "uhhhhhh, let talk about that".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It probably saved our house in this case. Repair person supposed to be here any minute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can also follow the cat actual: ButtersOK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still contend we need to fast forward to 2022.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is awesome! My grandma was also a Beatrice, who would also have been 102 this year. And she would have voted too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. I get that. So much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are the second person I've seen do this in recent days. Clearly people are perfecting skills during COVID!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The number of people everywhere who misunderstand all these rules is staggering. I had to explain to a higher ed person that while HIPAA didn't apply to them, FERPA did. How they missed that in their annual FERPA training is beyond me ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might have. I wonder if they lost control of it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I should have tagged densaer and IfNotPike in this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. That repeater was our only connection to civilization back when I was in SAR there (pre cell or sat phone days).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This video is from the Halls Ridge radio tower NW of Detroit, Oregon during the Beachie fire last month. It provides critical radio comms for public safety. That part at the end is the camera lens melting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: it was not the fault of the fuse. It did what it was supposed to do. The replacement went out in a shower of sparks. So now we wait until Tuesday and hope whatever it is is still under warranty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, the hospitalized president just went for a Sunday drive with a highly contagious, potentially lethal virus spreading from him, exposing all his secret service detail?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used QRZ practice exams. And basically memorized them. I took a class, but it was not very helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When someone threatened to kill me on Twitter, you literally did not care. And the police were confused, but they took my report.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't want to entirely void the warranty, just in case whatever caused the fuse to blow is the actual problem ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have successfully completed step one of self diagnosing the HVAC failure. 12 cent automotive fuse is blown. And of course we don't have that kind anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missing cat toy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, fair enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That doesn't look like a hospital . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's still under the original warranty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad the two of you are Twitter friends because these two posts made me laugh hysterically.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of the schools I work with effectively did that. They contained a malware spread by disconnecting a single building from the rest of the network.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anybody else in SMEM or EMGTWitter land try this out yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were home schooled. We mostly were stuck with anti-science ideas. Which have come to think of as very anti-American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem lies in devaluing the word. When everything is some sort of "pandemic" then it loses its true meaning. 1 million people have died from the actual pandemic, but when the word starts to mean something else it becomes hard to convey reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going with at least 10 years. I sent people to that training that long ago. Also COMT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, agree. Her use of infodemic was related to the sheer volume of information and the difficulty in figuring out accurate from inaccurate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At one of the Seattle area fires earlier this month, we ran out of tenders and the airport sent an ARFF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They only have one now. They had basic and advanced and now it's just going to be Situation Awareness. I think the course number will be 143, but I'm not sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mom was the permit agent for many years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought they had mostly stopped the big open burns and were just doing it with the giant towable flame thrower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just helped rewrite the FEMA SA class. We added a whole chunk of decision making. That's the whole reason we gather info, but we don't ever teach what to do with it. We just assume that people know how, but they don't when things get complex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Oregon, fleets of water tenders owned by grass seed farmers went to work fighting wildfire. They no longer burn grass seed fields, but the farmers all still had the tenders. There's a great photo I saw of them last week..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It felt like it too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I answered a call from an AP reporter on a fire once. 300+ articles later, my dad was very impressed. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uhhhhhhhhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to move a grandfather clock by myself at 2 AM once to retrieve a mouse the cats had brought in. Then I had to catch the mouse. It was ... fun?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes that unexpected freedom can be a great thing. Even if it happened for unpleasant reasons. Gives us a minute to sort out who we are and what we actually want, rather than being stuck in whatever pigeon hole we ended up in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Or we just sort of quit trying. After a day of video meetings. I don't want to do an evening of them too, even if they're for fun. Being "on" all day is exhausting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can remember doing that multiple times in NWS calls before they just started auto muting everyone all the time. Good times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recent conference call. Someone isn't muted before the call starts. A string of explitives freely flows. I mute it. Then text the voice I clearly recognized."hey chief, you weren't on mute".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'll just say I'm confused that the fed's reaction to discussion of defunding the police is to defund the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. A lot of our students manage to get them during their internships. Up until this year at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They only ones I've seen are in 911. At least that I can think of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm confused. That job doesn't say it's entry level. It's clearly for someone with experience. Are you assuming entry-level because of the coordinator title? That's a very generic term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was trying to say "now ambivalent"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three years of experience is not entry level. Entry level is less than one year experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've gotten used to it in hockey. I hated it, but am not ambivalent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have more than 300 people in our country who need 300. We're going to start doing Zoom deliveries next month. And we're doing an EMI sponsored HSEEP class remotely in November.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh great. I have listen to Collinsworth for the next three hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But right now, nobody can get training at all due to COVID. Places offering 300/400 are very much prioritizing people who HAVE to have it for their jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No.. Training is offered and certified differently. Most schools are not authorized training providers. Plus, those classes are designed for people with experience.Most students are not eligible to take 300/400. HSEEP though can usually be obtained by students.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They got a federal declaration though, so there should be some assistance for people or businesses who were uninsured or underinsured.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The power is back!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or one women apparently . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's meteorology. Which is great for them/you. But it can be applied universally to professions that aren't meteorology. Not all professions can use that same metric. Such as EM, IT, cyber, and others that accept experiential learning as an entry point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are scores of IT and cyber professionals who are part of the IT and cyber professions , who have neither degrees or certifications. What's required is the ability to do the job. Same as EM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your argument was that degrees and certifications are required for EM to be a profession. I just scrolled back and made sure I read that right. My argument is that those things are not required in order for something to be a profession. IT and cyber are the prime examples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's crap Rob and you know it by now. Try telling an IT or cyber professional they're not in a profession. There are so many vectors in and so many different paths once you get there that there is no "one way". Just like EM. I'm very tired of the gate keeper stance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey PSETalk , how come you're not pushing text updates on this? The last text I got, at 0737 said ETA of 0930. The website now says 1830.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is what he believes for sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're not there yet. Still 136.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I normally leave them on the power conditioner, but did not for some reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We'll fire up the generator if it comes to that. I used the last of my ups to top of my Surface for my last meeting of the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also discovered that my GoalZero batteries have inexplicably drained. I pulled them out to run my Surface and no joy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you're a Microsoft shop, I'd build it in something like SharePoint or a wiki page that is editable in-house through your existing authenticated logins, but made publicly viewable. If you're a Google shop, I'd do the same but in Google's version of those tools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And by visitors, do you mean you want visitors to be able to update the info or just view it? Do you want your staff to be able to login and update? More info needed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you just trying to read what other people have compiled or do you want something that you can compile? There are lots of sit related sites you can gather info from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I'm going to take back my take back! That notice had a tracking number associated with it already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I take back my take back. I knew I remembered October.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scratch that. The website says shipping by tomorrow. I could have sworn it was October originally.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That is in fact a top tweet. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. Mine is showing activity now, which it was not before. I didn't dig to see if my top tweets were accurate or not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well this sucks. Smoke is not going away any time soon ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are still an inordinate number of people who learned "most good for the most people" and fail to recognize that "the most people" always leaves out the same groups of people. EM isn't about field triage, and yet we convey that mindset a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. That's aweful. Should get her a gas mask to wear to make a point ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least those are cool. It keeps trying to sell me these.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have a new niece. She's pretty perfect. Mama had a rough time. All is good though. It's been A DAY.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And most local cops don't really understand cyber anything. When I had to report online death threats, the officer dutifully took my report, but essentially had no idea what I was getting on about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Awwwwwww. Big floof!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This year is horrible and just keeps getting worse. I know we have to keep trucking along, but I'm tired and there's no end in sight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long ago I had a Bendix-King radio. You could field program it by jumping two connections with a car key. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This weather is so crazy. In running the dryer and it's causing condensation on the outside of my windows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized autocorrect got me hard. That was supposed to say giggle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We binge watched it on the weekends when I was deployed in June. It was fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometime in the next day or so I'm going to be an auntie again. It's very exciting. Another niece!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keeping my hopes up for all of you. I grew up around there and my parents lived a block from the church until a few years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it wrong for me to Google every time the commercial the mentions Space Force comes on during NHL games?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I just heard SamLMontano on TV!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got this when I still had an office and needed a business card holder too. Turns out that slot also holds weird oversized coins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our HVAC is doing a really good job of keeping the inside air clean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have great central air in our house and have been running the fan on it constantly since about Monday. There is very little smoke in the house. I can't smell any, but I am more sneezy, so there's definitely some in there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was doing a vol gig once. A crazy guy threatened to kill me. I reported it to a partner. He said "I have mental illness, could we not call it crazy?" I said "he just threatened to kill me. Can we focus on that?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just checked and my hometown in Oregon is over 500.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm staying in my house, taking a darkweb workshop all day. And the central air is doing a great job of keeping the smoke out of the house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. These air quality monitors out of Oregon are aweful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spending my day doing this. Which was a good advance call since going outside is a horrible idea right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, my yard buddy lucked into a leftover cinnamon roll. He ate the whole thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's pandemic armageddon dinner..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy sunflower at the neighbor's house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dropped out of a for-profit ABD. Do not recommend!! I was doing public policy/admin with HS/terrorism policy track and EM track. I'm a fan of JSU still and wish I had gone that route for their DSci.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They did, as a direct response to the hot garbage coming from Q..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wrote something similar in my PhD program. From a policy perspective, it has always been hot garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd argue that starting fires is very extreme. I've not heard any of those reports via the scanner or from family in the area though. Lots of rumors, but so far that's it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've also spent a lot of time measuring distances around there. It's probably not a healthy hobby. I was glad to see it slow though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's was a nope.. Iron even lower than last time.. damnit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gonna go try to donate blood again. Crossing my fingers that I've gotten my iron levels back up to where they need to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sloth was pretty cute. They had those when we were there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW, for those unfamiliar with trees and whatnot, BLM is the Bureau of Land Management. This is very relevant in the context of fires, since they own a lot of the land that is on fire. They also did not start the fires, lest you are also confused about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first call was back inside my station to tell them to turn the TV on. Had just gotten off graveyard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally found a map that includes all of the evacuation areas for Oregon:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like the whole narrative is suffering from rose colored glasses. I worked in LE at the time. I can't count the number of calls we got about people who were "suspicious" because of their skin color or because of how they dressed. It was aweful. It still is aweful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And from your bio, I can see that you don't approve of those "handouts" to first responders since they are neither elderly or disabled, but they dedicated a LOT to help others and they deserved the support they were promised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've also had friends who responded to 9/11 contract cancer and now I've gotten to watch this administration gut the funds that were designed to care for them. So don't for ONE MINUTE tell me I don't respect the people who died or responded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bad guys committed the act, but we made the choice to not prevent it. If you know something bad is going to happen, don't you have an obligation to stop it instead of ignore it? In my world, you absolutely do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no lack of respect for the fallen. And we were at fault for ignoring our own intelligence services. Read the 9/11 Commission report. We 100% had the opportunity to stop it. Our leadership chose to ignore the it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I'm the only person in emergency management world who doesn't want to relive 9/11, thinks that Muslims and people of color were treated horribly in the aftermath, and thinks we gave away so many civil liberties that our nation is basically ok with 200K COVID deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general, I agree, but they're acting as a militia and trying to decide who can come and go and people are getting pissed/scared/etc. and calling 911, diverting cops to deal with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good god. Oregon cops having to deal with "heavily armed, defiant" people, who are trespassing, ignoring evacuation orders, and say they are "hunting for antifa starting fires". They're having to redirect LE resources from fire duties to deal with these assclowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It did,, but an excavation company and a bunch of volunteers dug firelines around the buildings (and others). And there were some fire engines. My parents used to live down the hill and went to church with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is good news, as is the fact the the Ranch buildings seem to have mostly been saved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they're fleeing to other states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About an hour ago ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It fixed shortly after I posted that and has glitched a couple of times since. It happens! Thanks for making it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, saw that.. Odds of getting one are pretty low though. Numbers don't add up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand purses, except very small ones to go with fancy dresses. I need a backpack with pocket for organizing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not good, not good at all. Looks like the Santiam, Riverside, and Wilhoit fires are very close to merging, if they haven't already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet that might change if you tried this with raw cow liver ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been plotting addresses of people we know and measuring distance from fire. Not a positive hobby, but provides info at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one is same data, different view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This straight up terrifies me. Sis's inlaws all live in that area of convergence. They all evacuated, but ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, been watching. They're going to converge at the Wilhoit fire, essentially at Scotts Mills. I've been measuring distances since last night. I never though I would see a day like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here was the first one. NikonNoFilter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tiny good news. Between mutual aid, an excavation company, and other people, it sounds like the were able to protect most of the structures at the Scout Ranch. Now getting semi-regular updates from the parents, who are getting them from the people who live there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think "should have known" is the right term though, because I'm not sure that what he knows is actually consistent from day-to-day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ability to measure how far fire X is from family and friends homes is both amazing and terrifying. This was the Scout Ranch, in the hills above where we used to live. They weren't able to evac all the horses, so they cut the fences and opened gates before they left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The newest NHLSeattle_ fan. SeattleKraken KrakenCrew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with fire maps is that I can watch as things I know and love are gobbled up and as the fire moves to eat more of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do not call 911 to report this..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for this map. This one also shows the satellite data, though displayed differently:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It just compounds our existing hell. Resources are already spread thin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They actually caught a guy up here, lighting a fire in the freeway median. He's in jail now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome. Sorry for the all smoke. Hoping for the best for you home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friend of a friend, could really use some internet love (and $$). They got good news today, but 2 months of hospital bills is something they don't the resources for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More Twitter oddities: I blocked someone horrible because they keep showing up in my searches for the fire near my hometown. And the block person keeps showing up in my searches. And they're still horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. firemappers map seems to be broken. Wants me to login to view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear twitter, you are incorrect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Test subject was unamused. I'm going to love this camera though, even if she does not. nikon nikonz5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless you can actually get me my package, there's not much to do. Mostly I'm irritated that they made up a weather delay yesterday and today didn't bother to try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least FedEx was honest today. They didn't even try to deliver it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTAF is wrong with people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fire was at Spangler at 213, on the west side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new precious has arrived! From NikonUSA. So excited! And I will now that UPS actually delivers things on schedule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess FedEx has gotten bad at actual deliveries too. My delivery yesterday had a "weather delay". One a hot sunny day, with no fires near me. It was loaded back on a delivery vehicle 2 miles from my house at 0300, but has a "pending" delivery date. This is the second time ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oopsies ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can find yourself on this evacuation map for Clackamas county.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a small world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All my fav places from my teen years are gone. And the fires are headed directly toward every place I lived from birth to 16, plus some time in my early 20s. All under level 3 evac. Thank god we moved the parents a few years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I wish HopeAACR made house calls ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know you, but I'm sorry that all of this happened to you. It's horrible to not be believed. And you know this, but I'll say it anyway. You were not at fault. He should not have been an asshole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Family is safe. Shirt-tale relatives are safe. Tracking a lot of homes lost among family friends. And watching as the three fires are about to merge where I grew up. Horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just measured a bunch of distances because it looks like three of Oregon's fire are about to merge into one, right where I used to live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can look up by address, then measure distance here:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly the story I needed today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was crying at my desk night. Just little sniffles until my husband walked in and asked what was wrong. Then I could barely talk. ugh. And I'm mentioning liberally because it's ok to be sad and cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's also the issue of your post office address being far away from an actual town. So they might have a Sublimity address, but not actual be inside the city limits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's actually the same now. Level 2 is Warning (be ready) and Level 3 is GO NOW (mandatory). The thing is that new fires are popping up that unrelated to the big ones, which is why some people are getting GO NOW when maybe they weren't expecting it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are the general evacuation areas. They probably got a knock because there was a fire encroaching on their specific location. Since they were at Level 2, they should have been ready to go when that knock came.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This happened for a while in Clackamas county last night. They actually said they were not going to try to fight some of it because they didn't have the resources. Including staffing, fuel, water. I heard them say "we'll have to make do with what we have"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Oregon ones were mostly started by a windstorm that caused power lines to spark. The only way to prevent that is to cut the power before the wind, which they have been trying in California. But shutting on the power in the middle of extreme heat also kills people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canada does have massive fires, but they are further north, so it is generally cooler there. And can't water an entire state except with rain. Which there is a lack of. Climate change has made a big impact on when the rain falls too, so there's been extra vegetation die off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I was listening to it. They were hampered by access and lack of resources. When they first dispatched that car fire that seems to have started it, the nearest available engine was in Estacada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard the Spangler Road IC last night say "we're going to try to keep it from jumping the road. We probably can't, but that's the goal". They're just beat down and overwhelmed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current evacuation notices for Marion County, with a link to Clackamas County. SantiamFire BeachieCreekFire LionsheadFire RiversideFire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that was probably a very small localized fire. Not part of the 130,000 acres that's burned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of the Oregon fires are contained that I'm aware of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just chatted with an EM friend in Bonney Lake. Fire is about 1 mile from them, but headed away right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the bottom line is that anything that catches fire anywhere in the county, people need to be ready to go because there's no way to control any of it. So everybody be ready.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm listening to the scanner. And these guys know they're losing the battle. Car fire turned into brush fire, which they can't contain. Evacs going just outside Oregon City.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically all of Clackamas County is now Level 1 evac or higher:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wierdly, one of the first things I noted was that the pizza place of my youth burned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm mostly doom scrolling and scanner heading tonight. it's way to personal for me to be actual useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's how parents are sometimes. Marion County side is at Level 3 also though. Deputies are going door-to-door on the Clackamas County side right now doing evacs on Nowlens Bridge Rd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good fire data map from Salem_Statesman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. And I really didn't think there was that much left to unravel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been having some convos with friends on the west side. And the reality when this over is going to unbearable. Both loss of life and loss of property.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to the Clackamas and Marion County police and fire scanners. Just heard the coastal fire departments roll in to Clackamas county and get assigned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a kid, one of my fav things there was their giant stamp collection!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I grew up swimming in the pool here. Until the pool burned down in the 80s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I spent 9 years in SAR on the west side of that mountain. Sometimes on that mountain. Everything up the canyon is gone from what I've seen/heard. I can't even image. Dad remembers the Detroit fire from the 50s, but that pales in comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was me last night! Slept with a bra on so I wouldn't have to fiddle with one in the dark if the power went out. Kept my yoga pants next to the bed, with a flashlight in the pocket and the big flashlight on the dresser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night was ugly here. During the day we ran out of fire units and were borrowing from the airport and the other half of the county.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought you were central WA for some reason. Be safe. Fire is terrifying. Say hi to my mountain next time it peaks out though (that would be Jefferson).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things really calmed down here tonight. Humidity is up from 10% to 28% and there's no wind at all currently. Still fires everywhere, but not the running kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, you're in Oregon now? I'm gutted watching what's burned and going to burn. Everyplace I lived from birth to 16 (plus some of my 20s) is in Level 3. So glad we moved my parents a few years ago or they would be in the middle of it. All their friends are though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Laundry hamper or laundry basket can make an ok cat carrier, as long as you can secure the top. My sis did that for her first hurricane after they moved to FL from OR. But I'm glad you got another carrier. Easier than the hamper and bungie cord method!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The newest level 3 evacs include every place I lived from birth to 16, plus some time in my early 20s. I'm so glad we moved my parents a few years back. They would be scrambling right now. Instead, they're hoping their friends and family make good choices and stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's the evac map, which includes much of Molalla..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, lovely there. With good cheese. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW, are you an Oregonian originally?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This evac map covers every place I live from the age of birth to 16. Plus some time in my late teens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to work for both Metcom and mcso back on the day. I'm heartbroken right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was just coming here to say that.. Thanks.. Salem is safe at the moment though..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My siblings and I are in a group text. None of us live there anymore, but we all have friends and other family there. Taking inventory of what we know to be lost already. Thankfully no people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just started looking in earnest at the fires in Oregon. And now I'm sitting at my desk crying. All the places I grew up around are burned or are likely to before night. So thankful we moved my parents a few years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are a long way apart. The fires are many and huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is heartbreaking. This is a tiny town. I used to live there. My parents lived there until about 5 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it was closed at the Oregon/California border at one point. Might still be. People going north were turned back to California.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you watch the cameras for a couple minutes, you'll see the airport crash rescue truck headed to that fire. Because we're getting low of fire trucks ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can see some of it here:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This looks like the closest one and all you can see is the smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had ones yesterday on SR 167 and SR 410. Now I'm going to go look at traffic cams and see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Humidity now 10%. 4 large fires across South King County. One being treated as two fires because it spans I5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. But the math doesn't really work out that way ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you know that exactly nobody is going to save that extra money they get for the next 4 months so that they can eat come January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This just guts me. I grew up in Clackamas and Marion counties and it seems like a lot of my favorite places are burning right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Samesies. And it's not the kind you can just click through, or leave running on a different screen. You have to actually it in in your focus window, thus requiring use of a second computer in order to get anything done that day ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Stay safe down there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you even look at something, it catches fire. I'ts going to be a long, long 48 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I loved/hated dispatching on days like that. I've also since worked wildfires and the idea of ignoring an evac order terrifies me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry that people are stupid and making a hard day worse. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I typically go with a list, go straight to the stuff I want, and GTFO. The only place I will linger is the booze section.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Humidity outside is 12% right now, in Western WA. I've never seen this before that I can remember. I'm guess it's single digits up on the plateau and in the foothills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I listened in horror last night locally, in between rounding up crap in my yard and checking the status of various tree parts (some large) being blown around. The humidity at my house is 12% right now. In Western WA. I've never, ever seen this before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still have a lot of friends in SAR down there and I know they were trying to get people to get out over the weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your data when you upload. And though it says you can upload multiple files at once, it turns out that's a lie. But I'm hours into this application and just realized that issue. Now I have to upload 50 files 1 AT A TIME, the go try to figure out what might be missing from before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have found the WORST government website: the SBAgov certification website. It randomly eats data, mostly because it has no way to save until you're completely done with a page (which can take hours). And if you don't upload your docs first, the fill things in, it eats all 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF south King County? Who would do this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a wicked storm. Peak wind gust at the house has been 30 MPH. Humidity 18% and falling. Part of the neighbor's tree is in our yard. Which I found when I went out to secure all the things. Fire departments and power company getting hammered tonight. WAWX AuburnWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Butters seems distressed this evening. I don't think he likes the smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, wtf Islanders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The smoke has arrived in Western Washington. wawx auburnwa smoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oof. Not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the request of the neighbor, we now have a camera aimed at our shared fence. Because we're all tired of the neighborhood porcine problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Washington disaster nerds, this is a house for one of us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My granny did this, but with masking tape, in case she changed her mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friend in Denver showed me it was going to drop 50 degrees overnight (for the highs).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just saw a friend post video of I-90 near Moses Lake on Insta. You could barely see through the smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They *should" change, but will they? The changes I'm seeing so far are not the good kind. EMs being forced out or put in the hot seat for "failing" when they literally did everything they could with no support from above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a different experience with my 511 bags. After having two of them self-destruct at inopportune moments (strap issues both times), I switched to a GORUCK bag. Spendy, but I have zero doubts that it will outlast me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took the star tracker out for its maiden voyage tonight. Nothing cool here, except that it worked. No trailing! But I clearly have a stability problem that I need to figure out. And I need to get further out of town.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know several people who have done them in Gettysburg. Everyone has said they're great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want to see GoldenKnights and NYIslanders in the final round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my blue! But I've been thinking about switching to brown so I don't have to mute myself so much on boring calls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a Cuisinart. Right after lockdown started and every morning I had to hear about how horrible our toaster was. It and the espresso maker are the only things that get used every single day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A tiny regular convention oven! That makes perfect toast. It can serve as an air fryer too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! Toaster oven does the best sprouts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's yummy! Husband is carefully cutting each bite so it has crust on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smoked pork loin, with a bit of Combine Repellent from Viss in the dry rub. Mmmmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They in fact did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the great Seattle myth. It mostly doesn't rain from July 5 to September 30. which is why my yard is dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charlotte is an amazing writer and military vet and you should all read this very somber thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a lovely floof!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm never done with it. When I'm not using it, it's folding for COVID cures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's raining this morning. I did not think it was supposed to rain. I hope it clears up by dark tonight! Can't go stalk stars when it's cloudy ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vancouver doesn't deserve to win, but Demko doesn't deserve to lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shea!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I hope GEICO changes up their commercials next round. I'm done with taxidermy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They also have really good beer, as well as pie made by little old Lutheran ladies. And a great mustard museum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's Labor Day weekend. We should be glamping at the Gorge, getting ready for Dave Matthews to take the stage.. Instead, I'm home watching Stanley Cup Playoffs. This is ... strange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They got one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Van finally gets a shot??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right? One gets the sense that had he been in net for the whole series it might already be over and Van might have moved on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does golf have playoffs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try renting a couple from Lensrentals. Great way to try new things. And I can send you a coupon. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I traded in my D5100 for a discount on the Z5. And I'm keeping the 5600. It may become webcasting device. They have software for that now! I go the 5600 for a great price on eBay though. Watch there or Craigslist. People are starting to dump gear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm waiting on my new Nikon Z5 to arrive. So this weekend will be done on my D5600.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess what I'm going to try for the first time this weekend??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, hey, they called back. And they were great. And my self-induced problem is getting fixed ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad you said this. I just got a call from Costa Rica and hesitated. Then I remember this. Sure enough, it was Microsoft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Howard Dean swore today. I doubt it deboosted him ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anytime you want long-term sustained behavior change, follow the public health risk comms model. It's why we wear seat belts and don't smoke in buildings anymore. It can/does really help with tech user education too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my friends who has a public health background and is now in cyber does a talk like this. The first time I heard her say "it's like Chlamydia" I nearly died laughing. Not at her but at the people watching her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm checking flight schedules for SEA->MKE for tomorrow ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. That is magical. I need to find a real butcher around here that has amazing products like that. Though 16 lbs of Wagyu could not have been inexpensive. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a big<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an amazing thread about rice. You should read it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two hummingbirds this morning at the fountain! Squabbling over it I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should all go look at waterfalls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But without Peeps, we can't have microwave Peep wars!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sounds both amazing and terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Skipped day 6 because I was gone all day. Day 7: got through first 11 of Hanon during hockey intermission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd probably get eaten by the<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eastern WA fires probably. Starting an east wind event, which is going to drop all the Yakima smoke on us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I have to miss the Vegas game, Barzal better score.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And nobody from the Microsoft "Data Protection Department" ever got back to me ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not really good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only if it includes commentary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot I was getting things from EFF. I just got the shipping notice though and I'm very excited!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*raises hand*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now they're shuffling me off to somebody else. Except via e-mail. And the mystery people will maybe call me sometime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is going even worse than I could have anticipated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though this shirt has lived in our house for several years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was on one a few weeks ago. Maybe months ago at this point. Somebody had not bothered to get out of bed, had no shirt on. There are just some things you don't need to know about your colleagues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is so 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling Microsoft support. On the phone. This is probably not going to be great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my Master and Dynamic. but they are earbuds not over the head style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I wanted to thank you for asking this question because it really made me think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read this yesterday and it roamed my brain all night. For me, cognitive dissonance at play. It's easier for me to believe someone I care about is ill than to believe they actual condone the horrible things they say. Easier to accept they are ill than that they are a racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was gone all day yesterday. Today I guess I'm not allowed to leave my desk. It might break his heart when my life resumes in February. Also, that's a long time from now. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only congress can explain that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The interest accumulates on your loans for as long as you're in school. So the school is making cash and the lender is stacking up interest for as long as you're in school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I was pointing out that the longer you stay in, the more money they make. It has nothing to do with interest. It's the cash they get from you sticking around as long as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, the lender does. The schools don't loan the money.. They take the money that's loaned to you by a bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like that people trust me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our lovely lady was spectacular tonight. MtRainier IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did it out of anger the first time, after somebody put a can of pepsi in the freezer to cool off quick. It exploded. I found it and was so mad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to occasionally get tired of the fridge cesspool and clean it on the night shift. Containers and all went in the trash if it had developed a personality. I still wonder if people ever miss their tupperware.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go steal somebody else's from the fridge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I don't regret it per se, but it certainly wasn't worth $300k.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate tweeting from my phone. So many typos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just did the math on mine. I started borrowing in 2006. Ended up with $152k over 10 years. I've paid $155k and have about $90k in principle left. I haven't done the math to see what the remainder will actually cost me, but one of them isn't scheduled to be done for 15 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, for federal loans Congress sets the interest rate. Which is currently 6.8%. Roughly double what the interest in my house is..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND schools done exactly encourage to hurry and finish. Especially for-profit schools that have shareholders they need to make money for. So some of your loans can accrue interest for 10 years while you're in school, before you every see a bill..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other thing that happens is if they are unsubsidized loans, the interest accrues the entire time you're in school. But you're not expected to make payments until you graduate. At which point all the accrued interest is added to the principle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great thread on the math behind a COVID vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a very important person try to pull that with me a couple of weeks ago. In the middle of an incident response. It's way funnier when a kid does it! FWIW, the meeting wasn't over, he clearly knows my name now, and he STFU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. They got back to me.. Said my order was still a pre-order. Person I talked to on the phone said they were in stock and started shipping last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alaska also has seats blocked so that there's nobody sitting next to you unless you're traveling with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I sneak bites through the bottom mostly. This mask has a snug setting and a less snug setting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it should say "can't". Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And of course that should say "from your face".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, since presumably you are not talking, coughing, sneezing, or otherwise spewing droplets from your while you put things in it, close it, and put your mask back on. You can deny people the ability to consume food and water for 6 hours either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You take your mask off briefly to eat or drink. Unless you are magic and can teleport then into your mouth .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, um, AlaskaAir is serving warm cookies in first class. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, I think Nana is a horrible name for a storm. Who wants a storm associated with everybody's grandma?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a PS frap last week and it was glorious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope it gets sorted out quickly. I was hoping to have it in time for the long weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 5. Made it all the way through Hanon number 10 during the last hockey intermission..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There will be a virtual edition of DisasterDrinks on Thursday at 1730 PDT. DM me for invite. Shop talk will be strongly discouraged. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No ot. I have to get up at 0500.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to show more enthusiasm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll send my neighbor's pigs over to help with that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying to rekindle and old hobby (playing the piano) and start a new one. The new one (astrophotography) will force me to go outside. Neither has anything to do with work or a computer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad he was looking forward to my response .... NotTodaySatan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We rented a condo once for vacation. The bathroom had clearly been an addition that used to be a deck. It had a giant whirlpool tub, then a step up and a toilet, built on a riser. Mirrors all the way around the entire bathroom, and green shag carpet. We laughed so hard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo. NikonUSA can't find a record that they shipped my new Z5 camera and they didn't charge me for it. They started shipping last Friday. I can't even look up the order in the system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suppose I'm going to be known for starting the Great Pig War of 2020 in my neighborhood ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And apparently I'm incapable of typing a post without typos today. Would love an edit button ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just waiting to the pigs to figure out my other neighbor has a little water feature/pond thing. Pigs LOVE water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pad enough the neighborhood asshole cat pees on my stuff. The pigs are an entirely different matter. I supposed I'll end up the bad guy for complaining to animal control. Again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The suburbs are a wild place..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's par for the course on this one. It's been crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are two pot bellied pigs that my neighbor is unable to properly contain. Ugh..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My nephew got injured in December. It's taken him this long to jump through all the Army shenanigans to get surgery. They just gave him his appt info. For the wrong body part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suspect my suburban neighbor's pot belly pigs. He can't seem to keep them contained. Usually I see them in the security camera, but they evaded it somehow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's our favorite month in the preparedness community! And one of my favorite things is the 30Days30Ways challenge! Just do one thing everyday, or on the days you want to, to help yourself be better prepared. NPM2020 Preparedness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there's such a thing as pig Twitter and farm Twitter, I need their help. Is this the sort of damage a pig leaves behind? Also, pretty sure that's a hoof print.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess at least they were honest about their intentions. But serious, amazon, you suck for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, the really nice thing about Alaska joining OneWorld is that his Gold for Life on American will reciprocate to Alaska again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He hit a million on AmericanAir and decided to get a job with way less travel! Now he works 100% from home and did before COVID. And he can't go with me to most of the places I go for work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I disagree. It does dilute it some, but it makes it far easier for me to travel with my non-elite status spouse. There's value in that for me, personally. Especially now! Plus I really value the extra 50K miles AND the MVP status gift.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It starts with my alarm every morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still going to call it a cat toy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to our city and our team! You'll likely be asked to pick sides in the great coffee battle. Just don't say Dunkin ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me! For a horrible dial-up ISP called Brigadoon. They hired me as an "intern", but I ended up doing level 3 work because the level 3s were buried and happy to share passwords. In the end, they didn't finish paying me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not an option until I prove to myself that I'm actually going to play regularly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. I've stuck with acoustics my entire life.. We may get a Nord for the music studio upstairs. If I get a new one for myself, it's going to be the acoustic baby grand I've always dreamed of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband is a drummer. Blisters and super glue are a thing. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fingers hurt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 4. Playing piano was easier when I regularly ripped my fingernails off. I inexplicably quit when lockdown started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that wasn't exactly scheduled maintenance ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>California crabs are also inferior specimens! You gotta have PNW Dungeness crab!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well now. That's something I haven't managed to do in a very long time. BlueScreenOfDeath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blue crab is meh. Give me Dungy any day! And yes, we do make crab cakes out of it. Because it's yummy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just had to take a break because Butters was insistent about snuggling RIGHT NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit. Tyler, not Ryler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carter Hart, Shea Theodore, Matt Dumba, Ryler Johnson, Carey Price<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No directly, but raeBress made something for Twitter that does that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I like the good folks at Trace Labs. They make real effort to only be associated with good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day three of "is Sarah going to learn to play the piano again". Busted out the Hanon. Makes the fingers stronger. Dug out a piece that I KNOW I used to have memorized, complete with 30 year old red pencil marks from my teacher. Brain is unclear about how I ever played that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn't suspicious at all. Nope. NotTodaySatan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've eaten at outdoor dining at a couple of places since March, but not inside. So I'm not sure how to answer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is magic right here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll probably just start taking iron again ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Load up on salt for a couple of days before!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit. Tried to donate blood today. Iron is too low. Not like dangerously low, but too low for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. they use CloudFlare and CloudFlare uses the internet (duh) and the internet had a very bad morning. Hubby's phone starting make the sound of doom at 0300. My phone pinged at 0400 to make sure I knew the weather station was offline. Those two things were related ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to do more to educate the employers you work for then. I say this having been a recruiter. You're doing your customers a disservice if you're not bring them the best candidates AND explaining to them why they're the best. It's a gig economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would anyone fill their resume with resumes? I'm very confused by this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ambient Weather by chance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out my weather station also doubles as a CloudFlare monitor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do I shut off this new Twitter feature where my timeline is spammed every time somebody I follow likes something? I have look and find nothing ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caturday mood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This piano is leaving one way or the other. The only question is whether it gets replaced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Played piano again today. Maybe this is the thing I'm going to relearn during the rest the pandemic. I also went down the rabbit hole of researching a new piano, since I've had this one since 1989. And then decided if I can't make myself play every day, I'm not getting a new one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to head off to our appointment to buy new loot at the NHLSeattle_ team store. It's the first fun thing I've done in months! GoKraken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cat loves ice cream. He recognizes the bowl I eat it out of. He now considers yogurt to be less cold ice cream and waits until I finish so he can lick it out. And by wait, I mean stands on my desk and stares at it while I'm eating it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I played my piano for the first time in "a while" last night. My pinkies are angry today ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is exactly what I said to my husband last week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't be offended if you unfollow when we're done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to send you a DM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in case anybody forgot, Wired had a great article about catching the MAGA Bomber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was my dream to run something like this when I was working on my PhD. Instead, I dropped my PhD and continued with the slog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we need policy/decision-makers to fund the needed changes. I feel like SamLMontano has thoughts on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except we won't. The next AARs will look like that last ones. We COULD do better. We often do not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody did this to me in my old job. I spent some time trying to figure out who it was. The best I could figure is that it *might* have been someone who had done volunteer work for us for a little bit, then had a last name change. I couldn't give a reference though. Felt bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The squirrels don't have routines, except to be in everybody's way. They occasionally go "bowling for crows" which is hilarious. They charge through a murder of crows, which inevitably jump back. Crows are all "WTF was that about".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yard routines: hummingbird comes about 9 AM for daily bath. The Stellars Jays do early morning yelling and afternoon snacks. The crows are usually here mid-morning and mid-afternoon. The flickers stop by for late afternoon drinks and bug hunting. Dove stops by early evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand how it works.. And how it could be exploited. But thanks..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. And they're still damned near impossible to use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! A new sticker has already found it's way to my computer. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ordered coasters from BadassBowden. They got here in record time! Also, I'm putting that mask on and running, just to prove I can safely run with scissors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In many cases, they share an arena.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's fine. I don't need my arm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Fidelity apparently sucks at both communication and releasing money. Been trying to close an account since July 12. No joy. Much stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Communities in Schools to try to collect & distribute 500 computers over the next two years. But the truth is, kids need them right now. Laptops with webcams are the ideal give, but anything is better than nothing. If you don't know how to do this, or where to give them, ask me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The digital divide is about to become a digital chasm as kids go back to school remotely. If you have old, but functional computers around, consider wiping the data, applying patches, and giving them away. I've given some away on Buy Nothing. My service club is working thru 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can also talk to your friends and family about racial injustice. Changing hearts and minds starts with the people close to us. Giving money and signing petitions is easy. Having real conversations with people is the hard part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang. Using poop to fight COVID-19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super spreader event. Like Sturgis, only less fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was really good conversation on last night's NHL broadcast about concrete steps that are being taken. Actions like this by the players highlight and strengthen those actions and encourage others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish Twitter had a hug button, but consider this to be one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know a lot of people in my infosec circles are job hunting. This job at AlaskaAir looks really cool! Plus I love them and they need awesome people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I worked out yesterday, for the first time since either February or March. I did not want to. Today, my body is very yelly about the workout. I'll do it again soon though, promise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially Brussels's sprouts. Roasted. Mmmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only because they haven't discovered Matt Dumba yet. They will scatter rapidly once they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This made me laugh way harder than it probably should have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I researched my toaster oven options. I found multiple reviews and actual humans who said the one I got makes a great air fryer. They were not wrong. It also makes the most perfect toast ever seen in this house. And bagels that don't get stuck and burn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toaster oven. A good one can also serve as an air fryer. Bought one at the beginning of lockdown. Don't know how we lived without it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This happens frequently with people from small states. They don't comprehend taking an entire day (or more) to drive across a state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Geography and maps are hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing is that we know from experience and research that not everyone can or will leave. There's severe inequity in people's ability to evacuate, even when they know they should. The next 48 hours there are going to be bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TFW when you check up on your LinkedIn profile and find a typo in the very first line. How long has THAT been there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The message gets modified to be applicable to specific cities, who transmit it through a variety of channels, including social service orgs, faith communities, neighbors, etc. When your neighbor calls and says "we gotta go and I'll give you a ride", that's the motivator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not designed to be heard through "the media" in the national sense. It's designed to be broadcast through local media and trusted agents in local communities, where people are used to getting reliable information from. Local media has much less doom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And getting out of the way is no easy task, especially in COVID, especially in a location where people don't have their own transportation. Especially when they don't know where they will go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a risk communicator, this is good language to use, along with the rest of the message. It lays out the threat, the consequences, and tells people an action to take. It's up to people in the community, and local officials, to get themselves and others out of harms way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an emergency manager, part of the reason this is terrifying is that we know right now there are people who will not or cannot evacuate. Despite the very best messaging from NWS and local officials. There will be loss of life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Thankfully I do not live in the gulf coast or work as a meteorologist! I stick to the disasters and communications parts. But it follow the "tell them the bad thing, then give them a task" model, which is how you motivate the non-believers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Part of what I teach in my graduate level risk communication class and what I practice as a public information officer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area emergency management job as the Director of EM for City of Seattle. EMJobs EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Unsurvivable storm surge" is a terrifying term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You were all awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grammarly is a key logger. I never thought about this before. My head just exploded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or people use those tiny devices to do video conferencing and we spend the entire call staring at either someone's thumb or someone's boobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, I know. I posted about that this morning. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to work out with my trainer today for the first time since I think February. Maybe March. I don't want to go. But I'm doing it anyway. It's my one small step.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn't have punched you, but I would have insisted that you drink some coffee that was actually good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seahawks, Thunderbirds, every team in NWHL. And until next year, the Knights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Logan Couture trending turned out to be not at all what I expected. I hope he remembered to tell his dad about dad's career change though ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a small business owner, sole proprietor, with direct federal contracts. I can't even donate a buck to a federal campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Name one person to whom they have applied in the last four years. I would not mind being wrong in this, but I'm aware of zero enforcement..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they've not enforced, they don't apply. That's my exact point. The rules are not applied to anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Vancouver goal looked like an all-srar game highlight. There's wasn't a Knight anywhere in the vicinity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I personally worry about breaking the Hatch Act rules and honestly, I don't even know why. They don't seem to apply to anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've met both. I'd go with Joe even if the other guy gets back to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quesadilla made with leftover steak, some fresh avocado, a bit of pico, some sour cream and, on mine, a nice little thread of Nope sauce. Mmmmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just remembered who the first one was. And I think it came by snail mail, because I opened it expecting stickers for my annual renewal. And instead, got shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably, but he also probably pays cash for them by the hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because I couldn't remember the second one (still can't) I did an inbox search. And found two more companies I've done biz with that use Blackbaud (in the e-mail headers) that I haven't gotten notices from yet. I suppose they're coming soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Blackbaud. I've gotten notices from two companies that used them. I can't figure out what info of mine was even compromised. One was the foundation of a healthcare system. I've never donated there, but I was a patient. Do not like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My schedule tomorrow: Teams, GoTo, Skype, Zoom. Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lady who cleans my house chats with my cat in Spanish the whole time she's here. I like to pretend he's actually learning something, but I know in my heart he's too dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zoom or Teams, broken into rooms/channels, with a moderator for each, and a controller who manages the whole thing. And a pre-session to make sure your participants have working tech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I ordered the Nope sauce from Viss. 1) it's sooooo good! 2) it came with stickers! 3) it's a good thing there were two Kevin stickers, because there was an immediate claim on those from both occupants of the house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The motto of 2020 is "can you see my screen?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm finally going to participate in summer camp event ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are all me. Plus "You talk too loud". I've embraced them and made them my own for the most part. It still stings in course evals when somebody complains that I'm too loud. I usually now tell people I'm loud and encourage them to move from the front row if loud is annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Verified account doesn't get banned for talking about punching Nazis. Go figure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I accidentally ended up in the middle of CPAC with my 15 year old niece. She asked me why everybody was so white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like how you think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have some really nice wine that we just hang on to for no reason. It's dumb to have nice wine and not drink it. So tonight, it's a bottle of 2008 Red Poetry Franc Merlot from Israel. Brought it back with us. Can't buy it here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good chair and good desk are a must, along with proper monitor placement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES! I have a Fully Jarvis desk. It a sit/stand. And given how much time I now spend at it, it an even wiser investment than I originally thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dig through Techsoup and see what might be available to you there for little or no cost (if you're already a 501(c)3).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This made me laugh so hard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*snort*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But how does one know for certain where one Zoom call ends and another begins?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The great thing about these responses is that fans are from all over the place!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But you trade around some of those draftees and magic can happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those are two stickers I still need for my new machine. And I will happy send a donation somewhere to get them! Just point me in the right direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking last night how glorious it would be to have Ryan Reaves on our team. smash, smash, chirp, chirp, maybe score every once in a while. Or, cluck, cluck as the case may be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should never have made the decision to de-prioritize their family in the first place. Who abandons their family to lie for the president? It took their daughter threatening to sue for emancipation for them to decide their family was important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This times 100. why do I have to have a user account and an avatar to get my freaking drivers? It's not like this for their linux drivers btw. Only Windows. And probably Mac.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yes, I'm aware that Twitter and TwitterSupport don't actually care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So twitter bans 1 out of literally hundreds of people who think that rapists should die. TwitterSupport why just one? One who who actually helps other people? What do you let people use your reporting system to target people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would put katestarbird on this list for her work on social media research.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was wierd hearing Oh Canada without some dude screaming "SONS" at the top of his lungs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm rooting for Tampa, for the simple reason that they're not the Bruins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what you get for watching a Bruins game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I know I won't ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I purged my closet yesterday of every pair of work pants and suits that didn't have pockets. I made one exception for a skirt suit that I love. I now have until February to rebuild my professional wardrobe. Almost all of it went on Buy Nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long ago, one of my guys said "Oh shit", in the middle of giving a plate, as the drunk driver took out a fire hydrant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did text my neighbor and say I was going to eat them if this keeps happening. She lamented the chickens that live on the other side of. This is what suburban woman actually get mad about BTW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the KING 5 special on the NHLSeattle_. It just occurred to me that we'll have enough ice in the Seattle area to host the world juniors now. That would be cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damned pigs are in my yard again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I'm about to start tinkering with SPSS. Free license through one of my employers ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've tinkered in R. I've never used SPSS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like you might have an opinion about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might need to learn SPSS this weekend. I've avoided it for a long time. But maybe I can do it in R?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I came to a truce with our city's tech support when I worked there. If I filed a ticket, they skipped the noob questions. They came to realized I had already done those things and something was actually broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband makes the list by aisle. I'm a "let's see what's down here" kind of person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so that's really cool. But I agree that it's probably a bad sign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed, yes. Although the opposite is also true. "Tried very hard to fix it themselves" is usually worse. I do not fondly remember my tech support days for a dial-up ISP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have two professional sides: EM and Cybersecurity. They are closely related, but distinct in some ways. In this particular instance, I'm a voluntary system administrator for a couple of non-profits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure what benefit there would be for a non-profit community service organization that has nothing to do with disasters to do drills! They wouldn't even know what one was. We do have monthly meetings though, where they're supposed to login ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uhhhhh, it's a non-profit org that's mostly little old ladies. We don't do drills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It cracked me up. We both grew up as farm girls, with our mom's cutting our hair. And here she was trotting across the country for a haircut. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my college roommates was able to arrange her work schedule for a long time so that she could visit her favorite stylist in San Francisco. She lived in NYC, and then DC. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night: so-and-so is having some trouble using Teams. Get on Zoom call to determine nature of trouble. Turns out that the person HAS NEVER TRIED TO LOGIN. Not even once. In nearly a year. Don't waste my time saying "having trouble". Just tell me "hasn't tried".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the locks need to not have keys ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will admit that part of the reason i'm still going to my regular hair appointments is that I'm hoping my hairstylist's business survives this. I adore her. And I can still afford to go, so I can. I also do like frequent color touchups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course it will. Because why not at this point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't done a covid-con yet. Mostly because after sitting all day in front of my computer watching people talk via video, I have little desire to pay for the same experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I like the term "emergency management professional".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I follow almost nobody for tech tweets. I follow tech people mostly for their non-tech tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A thing that only makes sense to those with the task book. And then only barely ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck! Do you know which fire? We've got structural crews scattered across multiple states from here now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, knock it off The_MattGreen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a colleague who always looks like Wilson in Home Improvement on video calls. I told her I'm getting her a real webcam and a desk tripod for Christmas. And Christmas might be next week. TBF, it's the angle she can best see her laptop screen from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pouring outside. This makes me very happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Friday and I suck at selfies, but I have a new NHLSeattle_ shirt to show off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my favorite thing on the Internet today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless you're getting Slizzard, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what? breaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I've had a headache for like 2 weeks now. I just sort of realized it's always there. Massage tomorrow, so hopefully that helps ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a pair of these in my office somewhere. Might be time to dig them out and experiment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what? Are you serious??? *frantically googles*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, you're not going to like the real banana.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got three different e-mails today with a emotet download. Apparently it's back and it's coming for me ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this did is remind me that it's 3 PM and I haven't had lunch yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working a cyber incident response right now. People, keep important phone numbers on something other than your servers. Keep local files, stuff on your phones, etc. Oof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the 90s, I helped found a non-profit for women in Tech. We recruited a lot of women. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friend with the goat named Kevin has a cat named Carl. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And offered for free to AARP members.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friend with a small pygmy goat herd named them all human names. I can only remember Kevin though, because he's who crawled up on me for a snuggle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But, you can upgrade to Cal King! This keeps man person's feet from hanging off the end of the bed at our house ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My last two goats were Big Goat and Little Goat. I am not good with the names. My niece however is. She has a small herd all named after plants Of course Clover is the only one I can remember.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ended up on a call with some new tech colleagues today. I was the only woman out of 10ish people. And I wasn't there to represent tech things. I just happen to also work in that space. Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know why afternoon snuggles have to be this way sometimes..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a couple that I put a chunk of work into. One's been burned and has to be deleted. The other continues to develop their personality and interests. They're very useful for OSINT stuff. Of course at this point I have to keep notes about my sock so I don't forget things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it's look a little old and manky, so a new one won't be a bad thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't find it. it's a textured surface. I know it's there though because there's water sloshing inside the top bowl and there's water on the ground underneath where there should not be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think macklemore should write us a new song for this purpose!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My bird fountain has a leak. I have to find a new one. The number one criteria is that it have a tiny little spot on the top so the hummingbird can continue to take his daily bath there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do now. And when they bought it, they sort of said they weren't going to do this forced account thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have HTC. We are not sad about that decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to ditch your oculus gear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, I'm neither young or Republican. She didn't stick around long enough to find out either though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landline phone *RING* Caller ID: Young Rebpublicans Me: [hell yes] me: Hello? actual humane lady: Hi. We're calling young Republicans like yourself to ... me: *Laughs hysterically* her: Adding you to the do-not-call list. Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG amazing! Congrats. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Twitter's stance is that Nazi's are in-fact people and they do not in-fact need to be punched. Their stance is also to selectively enforce this, based on what a quick search found for that phrase. twitter, you well and truly suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, who would even report that??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTAF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can the world handle two Veggies?? DethVeggie TodGemuese??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank god cuz I can't throw for shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mom is having the same issue. She's been making masks. Some of them never did arrive. She's had multiple packages sent to her that never arrived. Some had tracking and the post office just can't find them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. And I was uncaffeinated. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I specifically said they were bad with data. It's right there in the words i typed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've added six gallons of water to the bird fountain today. I think it only holds about 4. The neighborhood critters are appreciative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another example of government's inability to deal with big data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is buttersok. He has claimed the sunbeam. Everyone else must find their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just bought what I will now refer to as my first real tripod. I've had others, but this one is really nice. It's a BenroTripods Tripster. I wanted the carbon fiber one, but those are not to be found anywhere. Now if my new camera would just hurry up and get here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boo. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you sign up for MyChoice (it's free) and just put delivery instructions in? They're good about following them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just broke into a bottle of Basil Hayden's rye over the weekend. It's quite tasty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That still is one of the best things I've ever seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On good. I had a really awkward experience once where I saw a job posted and reached to the person who was in it to ask where they were going. They thought it was an error. They got canned the next day. Oops ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your first question should be: am I getting fired??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can always donate your GPU time to folding ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>800. 700, 15x. Depends on where you live ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should say "lived north". But yeah, it was fun. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were inaugural season ticket holders there because we loved north. Plus, coming from Portland, I very much could not be a Seattle fan. I got over it eventually though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(Everett still sucks)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I liked swings, followed by graves, followed by days. I hated days. I still miss that career though..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember trying to sleep days when I was dispatching nights. Summer sucked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someday, when this damned pandemic over, I'm going to visit the Isle of Whidbey and taste all the things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have central air. We are one of the few, maybe only, houses on our block that does. We also have a basement. It's about 64 down there. 73 on the main floor. 75ish on the second floor. The finished attic is roughly hellfire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a new Russian bakery here. I love pirozhki. I heated this one up a little too much though and blistered the inside of my lip. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It topped out here in Auburn at 3:15 at 98.8. It's very slowly dropping now ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've always been a huge fan. We lived on a rural mail route when I was a kid and the highlight of the day was the mail lady coming! Letters from penpals, catalogs of things I would never have with glossy photos, it was magic. I collected stamps too because I was that nerd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's terrifyingly beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Choose a different location. Only a few have that option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. I laughed so hard I have tears coming down my face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they're paying me extra income for that product, I would probably be ok with it. If they want to take the work I've done and not pay me more, I might tell them to GTFO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah, let's just fight like hell to save the usps. They serve way more needs than just ballots. And the serve places that the profit carriers don't. Did you know that in Alaska, the Post Office does final delivery on a lot of FedEx packages? By boat in some cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But even some smaller cities. 46 states! No, not coincidence. An intentional dismantling of the usps. Unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily we have ballot drop boxes here in King County, but yes, agree wholeheartedly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new Nikon Z5 camera arriving. I'm nearly giddy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to put them back. We need the USPS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now put the automated sorting machines back usps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh god. Nevermind. I see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I even want to look?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I set it up as a spot instance, so it goes a little further. And I mostly did it because I realized i was mere hours away from being knocked out of the top 20 by chriseng. And I decided I wanted to stay in the top 20. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm currently using my free Azure credits with a V100. When those are gone, I'll switch to Google. And so on. I might as well use their goodwill for good things!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come fold with us! We have cool loot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to suggest the addition of cadeedistillery. Makers of both Epic Shit Gin and Intrigue Gin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a pen pal when I was 6. My mom and her mom are still e-mail pals, 40 years later!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your account is locked, so they probably can't see you ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did this once so bad that I still remember it. I said, referring to one of the road guys "If I hear his voice again, I'm going to kill myself". I still also remember his highly irritating voice ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This song instantly reminded me of you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is amazing! Thanks for sharing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It does not feel like it was slow at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well there you go. Help save the post office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've been removing USPS drop boxes in Portland this week. I don't even know what to do about this. My mom is missing multiple packages now that the USPS just simply can't find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think my 3-day old migraine is finally leaving me. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I usually do something like "see the third paragraph of what you've quoted below" if I'm feeling cranky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so wrong. If you want to rebrand, fine, but you need to lose the verified account part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got them a Win 10 specifically so I could help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to call my mom for this week's edition of family tech support ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed, but small companies are often cash poor (especially right now) and if they don't have the capital, they don't have it. blood, turnip, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thankfully I was approved for a PPP loan right at the end of July.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet there's a strong correlation between people who drive into flood waters and people who won't wear masks ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Small business frustrations: 1 company won't pay me, 1 can't pay me because they haven't been paid, 1 forgot to pay me, and 1 has to be nagged to pay me every month. I've invested more time trying to get paid by the first one than I actually worked at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I already have a Fully sit/stand desk and an Aeron chair. I added a CUBII under-desk elliptical. Also got a USB connector for my Shure vocal mic and put it on a little tripod in front of my face. Major call audio upgrade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I've had to involve the police twice in online threats to me. It sucks. Plus, my local police were very confused by the internets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. Hacked account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think there should be a rule on this platform that if you die, you automatically lose your check mark. It's creepy that Cain's account is still tweeting and is still verified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dunno, that sounds pretty authentic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the only way to get out of student loans is to die. I've checked. Not worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've ended up doing some of the craziest usability tests for MS over the years. That one was more "hey, come play with the giant table". The one with head gear and eye trackers was wild. I had to vocalized my thought process. Non-stop monologue for 2 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got to user test that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should I bring ice cream, whipped cream, or both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Club seat season ticket holder. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My NHLSeattle_ bottle got a tiny upgrade..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ice cream. But only if it's the good kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just colleges. Nearly all of them offer 1 or 2 affordable 4 year degrees now, which were designed in conjunction with industry to address specific needs in the local workforce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're an awesome person. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the ones we got there were about curfews. But still, it was exciting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Community college! Though we've dropped the word community from them here in WA, they're still affordable and they still provide great basic fundamentals, like math and writing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got more in my month in DC than I have gotten total here in WA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I come to your house for dinner?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the highlights of teaching for GeorgetownEDM is listening to students present their Master's thesis. Especially if you are the advisor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should also say former TCAmericans netminder Carey Price. Gotta get all the Washington connections in there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what??? I've been working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I've been teaching at the college level since 2002. Not only are the standards lower but they vary tremendously with geographic location.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The GRE was so dumb when I took it. I started to study for it, decided it was stupid, and took it anyway. And it turned out that the University I was applying to required it, but they weighted it in such a way that I qualified for admission without it. It was a big waste of $$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was right above your Tweet in my timeline. My guess is they broke something in the roll out ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is what happens when utter boredom sets in ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's too late by the time they get to university. The sick burns online start about middle school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not see the costume part coming. I laughed heartily!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the reasons I love teaching at GeorgetownEDM. Though it seems to surprise some students that a) GU is a Jesuit institution; b) that Jesuits are concerned about justice and dignity; and c) that justice and dignity are important in the emergency and disaster sphere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I click on a lot of them. I like to know who I'm interacting with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I flew a red-eye home from Honolulu the night before, after teaching a class there, getting home the morning of the 11th. And that would turn out to be the last of my regular training work until next year sometime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been quite the saga.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. We live by a flight school and get random helicopters at all hours, but not everyday. Seems like you're are non-stop. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear god. This thread was the first thing I read when I woke up this morning. And apparently it will be the last one I read before I go to sleep. Get some rest peeps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tried to watch the WAP video, just to see what all the fuss is about. The snakes though. So many snakes. I had to quit watching. Is there a version that's been sanitized of snakes??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry your birthday sucks. Glad you're ok!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same thing happened to my niece.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be clear, I wasn't speculating. That was coming from a "knowing" perspective. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ok. Some version of the feds has followed this whole thread, all day ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll let you know how it goes. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our problem is that I like 5 stars and the other half likes approximately -2 stars. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I want Nope sauce just for the name!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I wrong or have all the women and non-binary people in this thread spoken at DC and/or BH?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh. Those are lovely graphics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's annoying on many fronts. You can't resize them until after you've added them, which means rearranging your entire screen twice. AND the 1x1 has no useful info from the looks of it. Just a picture of the conditions. No temp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey emgtwitter and other wx nerds, I need a new weather app recommendation. Used Weatherunderground for years. It's gone. Was using accuweather but they just got rid of their 1x1 widget, which I use. Got any others to recommend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter decided I must have mean nfldraft when I typed nhldraft. Clearly the algorithm is broken today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using the remainder of my free Azure credits to spinup a V100 to do a little folding. That thing smokes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my favorite HackerSummerCamp Tweet of all time maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm totally in it for the fat stacks of cash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that model is constantly changing. I had been going someplace for 10+years. Let my guard down. Ended up being physically harassed in what was ostensibly one of the safest places I go. Now I have a new, less safe, model. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is, based on all evidence available on Twitter. It's everywhere today ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their pronouns are right in their profile, publicly available. That's very basic OSINT right there. It's not even hidden a little bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's fun! Start off with a smaller one though if you're not used to driving large things. We started by renting a Class C, then eventually moved up to a 40 ft class A. We're talking about doing a Mt. Rushmore/Yellowstone trip by RV rental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know! I'm waiting on my new camera to ship. And now apparently for a star tracker to be made. I might take the old clunker camera out for one last spin this weekend anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not expect this to be an all-day event!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of us in EM never though it should have been assembled in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's only Monday. We can only go up from here, right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit! I got so confused with all this social once we quit using IRC. One option was much simpler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. I thought it was just a dating service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Red Cross does some of this work as well. They have a digital media unit. Most of them don't call it OSINT though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of disaster groups operate around OSINT, like SBTaskForce and HumanityRoad. I've done multiple missions with SBTF, looking for people who need assistance after disasters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally decided to try my hand at astrophotography. It's a thing I've long thought about doing. I figure with zero travel in my future and nice clear nights, now is a good time. And the both the tripod and the star tracker I want are backordered everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, my first academic paper is due to be published this fall. So I get the importance of publishing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is true, but I my great wish is that they would do both. Take your research, break it down, and explain it to the world. Why should people have to pay $$$$$$ to read your research? This is part of the reason our country has gotten scientifically stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why the 4th column on my Tweetdeck is catsoftwitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>12th place. Out of 244 entered teams. We'll do even better our second time around. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's beautiful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another TraceLabs OSINTSearchParty CTF in the books. We did pretty good for our first time as a team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's another in your midst who can pull off the pinstripes ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People! I finally got pictures of the hummingbird that comes to visit for a drink and a bath every morning! They're not great pics because screen + dirty window. But there it is! Look at it's wet little head! hummingbird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My old Oregon Scientific died after many, many years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weather station console. Or as the neighbors think of it, the console for the spying device I put on my garage roof. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a little workspace envy. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a mess, but it's my mess. Even TentacleKitty is getting in on the osintforgood-ness. I have a team for this year's TraceLabs CTF too! osintworkspace Tomorrow I will also have Fritos and ButtersOK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A message in a bottle! 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A surprise package arrived today. What could it be?? SeattleKraken SeattleSquidSquad NHLSeattle 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area temp emergency management job with Seattle/King County Public Health as a Logistics Section Support Branch Director. EMJobs EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area emergency management job with Dynamis as an exercise planner (Idaho and Oregon too). EMJobs EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area temp emergency management jobs (6) with Seattle/King County Public Health in the Health and Medical Area Command (HMAC). EMJobs EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area (and others) emergency management job, with consulting company WSP. EMJobs EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Finally decided to tackle a project I've been putting off. And found a password where there shouldn't be one. And can't get ahold of the person who probably has the password. This might be an excuse to play video games the rest of the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also loves you and is ready to receive pets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's finally less than 6 digits though ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. And for extra suck, I already know I'm going to only be there for Sat/Sun next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT? How did I miss this? Congrats. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. Not eligible under any program. AND only one was eligible for the emergency forbearance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to Seattle TheVoiceFitz!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a sweet mic setup. What mic is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yes, I know that ACA fixed the issue of future coverage, but that doesn't' address level of benefits, which can vary wildly from policy to policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a third one here, which might not be obvious. Health insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. It's the worst reason to have to stay in a job, but I know people who have/are for this exact reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like a steak or like a wine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They also have on-going operations for real missing people. It's not a CTF, but it's the same skillset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does them multiple times per year! Their next one is Saturday. I was a judge for one earlier this year and I'm participating again on Saturday as a contestant (with a team this time!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get excited for the OSINT CTFs. I LOVE THEM. I understand them and I'm good at them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So TikTok ban. Pretty sure the kids using it to organize the uprising won't be shy about a wee bit of civil disobedience and will keep right on using it. YouCantStopTheSignal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Sh1tt3rcon doesn't usually happen until Friday night I think. actualreverend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Should be in Vegas right now, after a successful day of getting defcon badges and nothing else. And we should be getting ready to head over to the r00t0wns gathering to hang with the rest of the olds. Instead, we had our septic pumped and are about to watch hockey on TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it was only Thighland when I was there ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, me too. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no! Get healthy again soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's that too. I keep thinking last month was June. Deploying for a month landed me in some weird time vortex I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking how nice it is to be back to normal for a day. Welcome to the PNW! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>K, he's a weirdo. ;P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More months without hockey! Boo! But it's the right call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another student loan gone. Only 4 more to go ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, that's not my coin. It's somebody else's. I just like it. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, rain. How I've missed you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what this is for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty excited to be invited to the OmdenaAI demo day this morning. One of their topics today is reuniting families after an earthquake using AI. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTAF???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind of new hell is this twitter?? I'm familiar with the notion that stories need to actually be read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently it's one of his campaign accounts, not the main account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally see the value of an umbrella.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His account is still live. He could be blocked from posting though. Facebook removed his post from earlier that says kids don't get COVID or some such nonsense. Same post was supposedly also made on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got mine already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too!! And I got $200 trade-in for my old clunker 5100. The 5600 will be my backup now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a move that came as a surprise to even the gate agents, AlaskaAir is now booking all seats in first class, not just half like they have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did that once. And I responded to the comments. And the troll did not return. To this day I am shocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just pre-ordered the new NikonUSA Z5. I'm so excited!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus players watching other games from the stands. I commented on the Olympic-like atmosphere over the weekend. It's cool, but weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, it only looks at the birds. Everything else is Arlo. For better or worse ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm supposed to be working, but my office assistance is quite vocal ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, the moment that discover has the new NHLSeattle_ card ready, I'm getting one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really missed hockey. But now I'm watching it wondering which of these guys will end up playing for NHLSeattle_. I guess we'll know in a year! I'm probably going to have to give up some strong, longstanding dislikes . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What he said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would add Argentinian or Chilean malbec to that list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! It's very rare to find someone alive after so long. Kudos to KCSAR and everybody else involved in this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one is so bad it feels like it's intentional. NotTodaySatan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my new favorite depiction of how masks prevent the spread of COVID. Bonus: the demo involves fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'll have to come for another visit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out my husband yells at the refs in NHL20 just as much as he does at real ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are multiple nets in the area. You should be able to reach the north and south end ones and check in as a guest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come fold with us! Loot is just a byproduct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Jesuits get all the cool kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As predicted by literally everyone. It's still cool though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Lt. Governor of our state is about to retire from politics and become a Jesuit priest. I can see cyrushabib and padresj getting along well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This poor Amazon package. From the looks of things though, Amazon has perfected the ability to teleport physical objects. No other way to get from California to Washington in 31 minutes ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the frickin thing is in California. Damnit AmazonHelp. Still can't cancel it or get it refunded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suppose this is the real reason we got a new TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, by asking me to login to send you the exact same information I just sent via DM. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. It's my home pedicure stuff. Times are desperate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll dm you the tracking number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You. You are the carrier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's now had the exact same status for more than 48 hours. No updates, no way to refund. WTF?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have a $5 refund from defcon and I feel like it could be a trap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love all the comments about defending the Constitution by delaying the vote. They seem to miss the point that with no election, Trump has to leave office in January regardless of anything else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My first hourly wage job a blueberry processing line. Had been a picker, then they came and got some of us to work the line. At some point in my life, I realized they only picked the white kids to do line work. And it wasn't because I was a good picker and earned a promotion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking I might go straight to whiskey today . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me either..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The economy retracted by a third in Q2, two prominent anti-mask Republicans are dead of COVID this morning, and the President wants to delay the election. Did I miss anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently amazon has lost my package. At one point yesterday it said it accidentally got shipped from Kent to Everett. Now it's just in the wind. And the product is now backordered, so I can't just order it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's amazing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do not like the fake background noise in the NHL broadcast games. They're muddy and unnecessary. MakeItStop NHLPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody lurking on this convo texted it to me!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'll also note he claims an IAEM affiliation that cannot be correct ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love you friend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine do that too. Though sometimes they forget to pick it up back up. The squirrels have been hauling dry grass over to dunk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This feels very relatable. Now I wonder what my own time looks like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're taking turns jumping in for baths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The crows are big fans of their new watering hole. They're bringing friends. There is much crow yelling going on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I grew up going to a tiny rural church. The lady across the street was 7th Day Adventist. She would mow her yard during our Sunday church service EVERY WEEK during mowing season. There was much hrumphing among the olds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dairy products can upset their tummies, just like they can human tummies. A few licks of ice cream every once in a while does not upset Butters tummy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It does! He's also decided that yogurt is as good as Icuce cream, but without the brain freeze.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He really, really loves it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ButtersOK. He loves ice cream more than almost anything on the planet. but sometimes he eats it too fast, gets brain freeze, and growls at it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's the specific reason that people running national campaigns and doing fundraising ask the federal contractor question on their forms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It does specifically apply to me because it prohibits companies with federal contracts from doing anything to publicly influence national elections. And because I'm a sole proprietor, I am personally the company. I wish I had realized that and created an LLC or S Corp early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what I've been saying for months. But, in true Seattle fashion, we'll find a way to own it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Team doesn't start play until Fall 2021. Hopefully we'll be in a much better place then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was the name I didn't want. But it's the team I already have season tickets for. PEOPLE, WE HAVE NHL HOCKEY IN OUR CITY!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First lesson for NHLSeattle_ : get a more robust web service. You live in the land of tech. I've been waiting for 10 minutes for your merch page to load. I just want to give you (more) of my money. But apparently nobody planned for scalability ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like the logo a lot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we'll be playing in the Climate Pledge Krak House. BUT, I don't care what they call the arena, or what they call the team. It's NHL HOCKEY IN SEATTLE AND I HAVE SEASON TICKETS!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what sucks. I feel that. but I also have a powerful need to pay my mortgage and eat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like I'm in a constant battle with myself for this very reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wooooooooo! And I'm glad they're announcing the name before we start to pay for our tickets. hockey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Went back and looked at the Sand Point, AK tide gauge from last night. Fascinating to see how the tsunami recorded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my fam in Alaska is safe. So I'm going to bed ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was a 1/2 foot bump over estimated tide at Sand Point at roughly the estimated time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tsunami missed its first five check-ins, so that's hopefully a good sign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't change though. That's how long it takes tsunami waves to traverse the ocean. The only question is if any are generated by a specific earthquake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only warning thus far are for Alaska, not the PNW. You can see the up-to-date list at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there is one. Still being evaluated for west coast.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I still donate to a lot of charities. Even some of those charities. It's important to look at what they actually do. Goodwill for instance employs a lot of people and provides job training. Red Cross supports fire and disaster survivors for no charge. 1/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Concentration in what though?? Sorry. I know you don't really have much choice, having probably committed to this thing, but ugh, I feel bad for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. I teach undergrad research methods. To the usual dismay of the students. Until they hit the real world 4 months later and discover they actually have to use those specific skills. I use the FEMA Higher Ed model course as a base even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will say that I think having one terrorism class is important (like what/how/who/why), because for worse, grant money is tied to it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I chaired IAEM's Theory to Practice working group of the Training and Education Committee for a while too. That group continues to push forward on this stuff too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The higher ed project has worked tirelessly on that for more than 20 years. They do a really good job of bringing academics and practitioners together for that purpose. BUT often the programs that most need to be there don't attend. They don't want to improve. They just want $$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're nerds who like science. Sometimes our tech is more about promoting things that promote science and other good things. We had talk about a disaster board game once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We reinvent far too many wheels in this profession, either because people don't know how to get their info into the right hands or because those hands prefer to make new wheels . . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think you misunderstood my response Marc. Ashley said she was going to research all the 50 states KSAs for EM reqs (or something along those lines). I was pointing out that she could collaborate with somebody who had already done it instead of reinventing the wheel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could be IAEMETC Tech Talk. We often hunt for the great talks with a tie to technology that get rejected by the main conference. We had 120 people cram around our booth for one once. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My point was that you don't have to start from scratch. You could collaborate with the person who has already started this effort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more student loan down. Only four to go ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very interesting that they specifically say that! Why make a scholarship that specifically excludes non-binary people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's an Advanced Academy paper in the NETC Library that covers this very topic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my colleagues did that for his Advanced Academy project. He's not on Twitter though. I could connect you via other means though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is very true. One of the other reasons for it is that some programs were designed a long time ago and were never updated. I inherited a class three years ago that was still talking about the NRF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's where you say "Luckily, science doesn't care what you believe. Get me a real nurse".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a cause worthy of a large Go-Fund-Me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why my aunt has been in public health for 30+ years. She loves it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's EffinBirds, right?? I got the Fuck 2020 version one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will also eliminate the Trump Republican Party candidates. I'll have to come up with some other criteria to whittle down the herd. The voters pamphlet is sure to be a hoot though! Only person missing from this round is Zamboni John, perpetual candidate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm trying to find a good government social media policy that's publicly available. gsmcon used to have links to the award winning ones, but no more. Anybody in smem land have one that's linkable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you need a hug or something??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Claimed payment to an inside source for access. And why would you do such a thing knowing you're going straight to jail??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was an interesting post from a reporter on Vice last night, which could be bogus, but they usually do decent reporting on such things, which claimed to have spoken with the culprits. Twitter made them take part of it down, which lends some credence to it. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what baffles me about the whole thing. If you're going to go, go big. What was the point otherwise? The amount they brought in isn't even going to cover the bail money for the insider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. I think the better choice would have been too shut the whole thing down for a bit. That way there would be no expectations of anything working..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that was fun Twitter. I have an evening meeting and more work to do tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That only covers issuing a false forecast. It doesn't cover hacking their accounts or the service that those accounts are hosted on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But is it getting the right engagement? That's why it's so important for communities to understand what platforms are actually used in their area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wholly disagree. Considering social media platforms to be public safety communications infrastructure is not the way to go. They are free services that we don't WANT more regulation of. The bad guys should be charged with whatever is on the books, but we don't need new laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But as a private service, for which they agreed to the terms, there's no guarantee of the service (whatever social media platform may be down) working at any given time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of our former cats developed a wicked limp after he lost a lot of weight. We just carried him around more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. And it's one of the few that can be accessed fully by non-account holders. Which makes it handy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm doing a mix of both tut-tut-tweeting and reminding people that they should always be thinking of other methods. Twitter is 25% of our population, at best (higher in metro areas). Opt in systems and other methods get better coverage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see you're back from Twitter jail!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not excited by this year. I want it to be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have an opt in system to reach your local community? That can be far more effective than Twitter since it's targeted. So can your Facebook page. Though I hate it, Facebook adoption is MUCH higher. 70%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was just coming here to say something like this. There's still drama to be had!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That isn't true. You have access to EAS in some way. That's the official way to send messages if you want people to get them. Only 25% of adults in the US even use twitter. We spend a lot of time dithering about something that reaches 1/4 of our population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. I've spent 18 years teaching emergency and emergency management law. It becomes very complex, ESPECIALLY since every social media account that opens signs a waiver that acknowledges there are not guarantees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Private sector companies have safety related things to pass on. Would they be included? I think of say, the power company. Private sector. Not government. Or a private nuclear power plant. Not government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And right now, none of those verified government accounts can post, but their unverified PIOs can. So who's more important at the moment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's subjective though. You have to write new laws that determine the importance of various social media accounts. You think government is more important. Kanye definitely thinks he is more important. And he has more money to throw into his cause than government does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I signed up for the tsunami stuff because I don't live in a tsunami zone, but I have family who does. I want to get their warnings!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EAS is still the nationwide official warning system, built into every cell phone, radio station, and local TV station. The only way you don't get those if you shut them off manually. Also, I keep a NOAA weather radio by my bed, for lahar warnings. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You probably just made somebody's head explode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, because it would be subjective. Do you get a bigger sentence for hacking Kanye's account because he's popular or for hacking the NWS severe storm warning account because it sends official warnings? They're both verified. And officially official warnings come via EAS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pew research says it's anybody over 18, excluding you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's particularly useful for reaching the media. And for reaching savvy users with specific message. I get alerts everything the automated NWR Tsunami account sends a message. Which it can't right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They better, since less than 25% of adults in the US even have a Twitter account. Twitter better be one of many paths for info dissemination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also evidence of MFA being bypassed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone I know in ye 'ole Army separated their shoulder in December. Is finally being allowed to see an actual specialist this week. The delay is for what appear to be a lot of really dumb reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just going to spend the rest of the day pointing out that less than 25% of adults in the US even use Twitter. We make it out to be far more important than it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there's the underlying issue of blocking whatever access the miscreants had to get in in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, you can see where people posted evidence of admin e-mails being changed. There's a LOT of cleanup work to be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that scam tweets were going up almost immediately after they were taken down speaks to automation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of it was ongoing, including when they changed bitcoin addresses. Unless it was an army of people, it had to be automated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably, since we essentially have none of the internal details. If you did a search on the bitcoin address though, before they blocked them, there were many, many unimportant accounts posting the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agreed with point one. I disagree with point 2. They took over a lot of accounts that had few followers and probably didn't even notice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of us hate Python so much we would pay $5 for one line of code.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Less than 25% of the adults in the US use Twitter. 70% use Facebook. The smartest ones probably use neither ... Thanks pewresearch for the stats ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter is one of many ways NWS sends warnings. They use the Emergency Alert System, which sends them straight to your phone/tv/radio in the affected area. Unless you shut them off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we all must have cat backups. Though I never got the blue check, I have buttersok who can fill in for me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I picked a hell of a day to rewrite the IS 42 class ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a DM-a-friend-moment, not unlike the Calgary floods a few years ago. Calgary FD (I think) got locked out of their account for sending too many tweets. So the PD did them all on their behalf. It's still bad, very bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is by far the best take I've seen on today's events. It totally checks out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or maybe they took them back down again. I saw one post that he could post, but that he couldn't reply to anybody. And then went radio silent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen tweets from several now. Maybe a slow roll out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, they still clearly do not have their arms around the actual incident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speak for yourself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think taking the whole thing down is the better option. That way everyone knows they're not going to get info here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. But yes on Biden and Obama. And Kanye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the problem with a total lockdown of all verified accounts. Just shut the whole platform down Twitter. smem EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a big deal for official agency accounts. smem emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I literally just said in slack "now we'll see if they had a plan to change addresses". And there you go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TBH, I follow Troy PD for the cats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That only took an hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Updating their resumes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahahaha. Twitter is apparently no laughing matter today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this point, I'm going to say Twitter could probably use the assist though. They seem to be ... in over their head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's the thing with the bitcoin scam. Yeah, it's pretty obvious. Except that people still get involved in pyramid schemes. People want to believe there's an easy way to make a buck. And it if only costs them a little bit to find out, they may well give it a shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would also be cause for some stupid executive order demanding that social media be shut down for national security reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or fewer people with Admin rights on the inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we're all just waiting and watching ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Common sense is stronger in Canada friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I lied. I can't stop watching. I'm guessing the people giving all their bitcoin to scammers are also the same people who won't wear masks ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the day we learned that Twitter knows nothing about security.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Woohoo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can. These are pets. They're super smart and can be very affectionate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, the story is that the guy up the street got two pigs. He lets them out to graze in his yard unsupervised, week no fence. Neighbor has talked to him three times this week about his roaming piggies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh, what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you support first responders, you support voting by mail. Shift workers have voted by absentee ballot for years because polling places are only open when they're supposed to be sleeping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But initially they argued with me that the nameless woman they were gossiping about was me. Me: yeah, that was me. Them: NO, blah, blah. Me: you're talking about X, right? Them: Yes. Me: can definitely confirm it is me you are talking about right now. There's video if it helps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That last line is the most important. I had the unfortunate experience last year of being harassed by a dude that was generally well liked by other women.

<|startoftext|>Waiting for bags. Met the person who identifies as dog's grandpaw, waiting to pick them up. Dog is in fact a trained therapy dog. Who is a little freaked out by all the people in masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a real service dog on this plane. The flight attendant was holding the leash while owner was in the bathroom. And dog, being a very good dog, picked a human who needed attention. Yes, it was guy who checked himself in and had his mask on his nose. Dog knows what's up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, special. Somebody is trying to break into one of my Facebook sock puppets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dropped the grad school class I was going to take this summer. Turns out I've done the exact same thing under a different name and I teach a more difficult undergrad version of the same thing. So I get my $1000 back . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably a squirrel. Those little buggers blow up a lot of power . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And of course he's in my row. As far away as possible. And he's wearing a mask now. Over his nose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh. Pretentious dude not wearing a mask just scanned his own boarding pass in with no gate agent present. After being told no. And then he boarded with pre-boarding.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I had not even see that emoji yet. My emoji game is roughly 180 degrees off point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That success came with a pretty damned high emotional toll though! Yeesh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best kind of trouble! The kind with masks ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is great news!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ah, the price of foldingathome! r00tfolds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That lahar photo is one of my favorites to use from Mt. St. Helens. I've used it for years in public education programs about lahars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, but it's a long drive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's not fair. But also, both discontinued our household favorites. TillamookDairy had their Cinnamon Horchata and Umpqua had their Ol' South Fudge Pie. Both were devine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like you should have tagged IanColdwater in this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shush you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was headed to the La Central bar at the Paris when, in my mind, I nearly collided with you and your posse of awesome. TBF, I had been passively looking for you, so was very excited to actually find you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine is crunchy months later. That's a feature, not a bug.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'll know as soon as you open it! It will either smell nice and fermented or nasty af.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I want to know if it's ok!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that happens. Leave it anyway if it happens again. The amount of liquid in the jar also varies with the temperature in the room. After a week, mine nearly always looks like it has no liquid, but after two weeks, it does again. Fermentation requires patience!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, did the sauerkraut fail again???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was built on this platform:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know. I'm asking the person who posted that to Slack to see if they know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can remember my grandma being SUPER ANGRY at somebody and on a rant, but we kids were around, so mid sentence, she spells out S H I T at full volume.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My bad. It was Morotola. It was the Safe Schools Virtual Showcase. And it looked like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seem to recall IBM just did something like this. l'll have to dig around and see if I can find it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss you guys! And the work you use to deliver me to! Soon though. I can feel it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adding to my own comment. Your professors are freaking out about this too. Most have never done it, have no idea how to do it, don't want to do it. My experience is that everybody is showing everybody a lot of grace and we're getting through it somehow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I bought an under desk elliptical. Some days I have almost no choice in how long I spend at my desk, but this keeps my legs busy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some did not forget. Some did not care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've concluded there's nothing much worse than listening to a call where you are being talked about as a thing instead of a person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the ones you're getting. I keep getting people asking if I want to use their company to hire more staff. I've gotten a little snarky with them ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point. Wearing pants protects nobody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly the shit Google pulls in our house!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait. It's Monday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does wearing a mask infringe on your civil liberties but wearing pants does not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever thought about getting your PI license? You could monetize enough of this to pay for your side hobby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a recruiter move my resume to their template. And somehow SME became "Small Medium Enterprise". I was so confused I could even parse what I had originally written and had to go back to my original. FWIW, I think it's hilarious and I'm glad I proofread.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's BeerThirty. With a rhinegeist slangria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've heard that about Lowes universally! I keep telling people in our town to go to the local Ace Hardware affiliate. Small business and not horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will not touch my hair. Sandi might stab me with her scissors when she finally gets to cut it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to see if I have any hair clips left in this house. My hair is officially that long again ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This wasn't a budget cut. It's a grant funded project. It's a straight-up money grab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the budget cuts and layoffs that are starting to happen, I doubt the parades will be top priority..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today sucks. I'm going Zoom drinking with some trusted colleagues. And then I'll play video games until I'm too tired to stay awake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh, yep. I think it was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmmmmm hmmmmmm. I have fam in that county.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still just a suggestion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, definitely a suggestion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So at 9:50 PM on this Tuesday night, I got an e-mail from my largest client letting me know they're not exercising the 5th of my contract. So as of June 6th, I guess I'm job hunting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me, half of today: what did I miss? Why won't these stupid Teams instance work? Then it occurred to me that it might be them. It was. Something, something, new rollout, ate system resources. rolled it back. Whatever. It works now. Whew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is mostly a girl problem. Why do we do this to ourselves? Impostor syndrome is the worst, but we do it so often! I include myself in we here ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister and parents live in this county. I am not at all surprised by this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe with the task force shut down states and counties will quick having their supplies "redirected".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the entire class was wondering wtf I had gone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the middle of giving a block of instruction via Zoom, some sort of parade went past my house. Cars covered in balloons and streamers, all honking. Lead by a police car I think. I have no idea what that was about. And apparently my audio/video glitched out at the same time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND, ask for what you're worth. Sometimes we start doing things as a hobby and they begin to consume our lives before we even know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not since they're only offered by a third party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not a big chips and dips fan. I though I love green chilies, they are a poor substitute for jalapenos. And to clarify, the Spicy Jalapeno Fritos from Fritolay have never been available here. I've only found them while travelling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want spicy jalapeno Fritos, but they don't sell them anywhere around here. I look on Amazon, but I'm too cheap to pay those prices, plus they would probably get smashed in transit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. OMG. OMG. Laughing sooooo hard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing, everybody but the person in charge got on the Teams call during the conference call, so now we're in both. Which is hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conference call starts in 7 minutes. At some point on the agenda, I'm supposed to "walk people through Teams". Except it's a phone conference, not a video conference. And I just don't even know how that's supposed to work. IHateMondays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Is. Awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing! Best thing I've seen on Twitter in days. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, but I'm also using it. It does make some things a LOT simpler for all of the non-profits I'm working with. A single consolidated platform (that's free for them) is much easier than trying to tie together zoom+slack+doc sharing from somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's interesting. Received first notice of the Dave Matthews Band Gorge show cancellation from the glamping tent vendor of all places. That's . . . . odd. DMBGorgeCrew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sorry to disappoint you my dear bot friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remembered to login today and put my Gogo account on suspend. Until August. That would mark 5 months of no travel, but we'll see if those August things actually happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most exciting thing to happen here in weeks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to your old account??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The problem is that this disaster mode is going to last way too long.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is so exceptionally true, particularly in Washington. Sales tax is a key source of income for a lot of cities and it's not there right now.

<|startoftext|>I meant which brand. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, but there are. Check out John Fluevog's shoes. AMAZING. Also, EXPENSIVE. But mostly, AMAZING. And a huge second hand market, so you rarely have to pay full price.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to have a pair that looked just like that. I wore them out! What are those?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because Florida is crazy. My brother-in-law works in a skilled nursing facility there. It's not a good situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And lest you have any illusions of what that experience might like, it's just like this. The youngest (which is never dad!) has to dig the hole. And there are usually randos with guns. We nearly always have them (2nd photo) ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Been trying to capture a stray cat that pees all over my back patio. Instead, caught gimpy neighborhood opossum. Scared the bejeezus out of husband when he went to start up the smoker. Mr. Opossum has been released back into suburbia. And we once again away that bastard cat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's absolutely normal! But leaving an inch of space makes less mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It took me a few tries to get the level right. Which meant burpy cabbage water on my counter a few times! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! But, that's too full. It's going to burp on your counter. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would indeed. There's clearly something amiss. My guess is it's some whitehouse program gone wrong and FEMA is taking the blame for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only unsolicited things I get in my DMs are connections from "good honest men". With zero followers and recycle profile pics. I'm guessing the cats and hockey scare off the rest. Or maybe the mask and crazy quarantine hair currently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've done some of those. We get a lot of us out of our smoker! We might have smoked chicken tomorrow, with either smoked or roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'm going to make bread pudding tomorrow, for the first time. With bourbon sauce. I rejected every recipe that called for a "splash" of bourbon. Then I remembered nancyfullerco. Sure enough, 1 CUP of bourbon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I pretty much live in socks. Turns out I hate my slippers and deeply regret buying them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's snuggles and purrs time with ButtersOK. Caturday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently it wanted out. Which can't happen when your human is on a call giving a report!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The guy speaking right now on this conference call has a cat apparently. And it loudly wants something. And now my cat wants to know why there's a cat meowing on my desk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had forgotten that before all this started, my ankle was in constant pain. I remembered last night, after wearing shoes for a couple of hours, 2 days in a row.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We designed a cat jail to he could still see us eat, but would have more difficulty joining us. Caturday LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And thus ends another week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp, during this quarantine, I managed to catalog 28980 sports cards that I've been packing around for more than 20 years. Mostly hockey. Now to send the list to my insurance broker since they're worth more than I thought!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've deployed alongside them! And stood in the middle of a destroyed street to make sure the Dish Network satellite guy they sent me didn't miss us! I love them very much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was my plan if this didn't work, but both were ok with Windows 10. And I don't think we have any older ones lying about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I rounded up our old, unused laptops, wiped them, installed Windows 10 on them (using the free upgrades from 7 that still work!) and now I'm giving them away on Buy Nothing, to try to at least help two families get through "virtual school".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing! We get to serve about 3000 people over 4 days. All kinds of people, from all walks of life. It is my favorite volunteer gig every year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully you laughed hard enough for both of you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're out! Like 4 of them. Birds are just not stopping by this week I guess!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because this .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But, you know why it had to be said *today*, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still not eating at RuthsChris, but at least they did something right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my volunteer things is the giant free medical clinic we have in Seattle every year. 150 dental chairs humming along. Dental tickets are the first thing to run out because it's the thing everybody needs. We had a family drive several hundred miles one year, just for dental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I got the big brain part anyway ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sucked. I've had three root canals in the past 9 months or so. My brother had 8 last year. Teeth are a love/hate thing for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A combination of being poor, drinking well water, and a hereditary conditions (aka genetics) and I ended up with 22 cavities in my mouth the first time I remember going to the dentist at about 12. And we had to go to the dental school because it was cheap. And it was so slow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that this has to be said is. Well, I don't even know. It's something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are words we should NEVER EVER HAVE TO SAY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! My brother gets gifts from his crows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this the outcome of that project you were working on last year where you were looking for small cities who wanted to participate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Masks are contraindicated in people who have breathing issues already, which should just reinforce to her that she should not be outside. Of course it won't, but ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to get an emergency root canal just over a month ago. Sucked, but so glad they were working! Even my regular dentist returned my call, but endodontics aren't his jam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only on the things I control!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my yard crows is definitely building a nest. She apparently couldn't find sticks the right length and was aggressively pecking long ones to make them shorter. They're so smart!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's free, so might be worth a shot. We set it up because of package theft initially. Now I just find it handy, especially knowing when packages requiring signatures are coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have a UPS Mychoice account setup? That might provide some insight and/or let you redirect to the house instead of to rando box.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I opened the window for a little extra air cooling, but the house lion interfered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just the way of the gig life right now, especially when many of those gigs are government ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was scrolling through the team list today and saw people I know from other parts of my life. I guess it's that Twitter influence drawing them in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annnnnnnd, another contract bites the dust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There has been no grape soda available in our store for weeks. So I ordered a case of jonessodaco grape and another of ginger beer. They arrived today. Yay for sweet sugary goodness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turned my Surface on for the first time since March 10. That's a *lot* of updates ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. I was going to volunteer my catfood dish as an example, for exactly this reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, still on Slack. Option to switch to Teams, but everybody is too busy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What group??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Skype for business also has this feature. I too use it for the greater good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've gone back and watched it 3 times! In full screen mode!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go find more! Slice them up, saute in a little butter. So yummy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmmmm. Morel mushroom. Sooooo yummy. They typically like clearings in the forest, but I guess a flower bed will do in a pinch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss travel. I've really realized how much I actually enjoy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are still flying. Alaska has blocked out the middle seats in coach and is only booking 50% of first class. Flights are stupid cheap. Masks are encouraged..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She made my hubby a Da de los Muertos, one, though I'm not certain she knows that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no members! Please don't tag me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Masks from my mama arrived today complete with instructions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just used my hands. I more or less kneeded it in a giant bowl like bread dough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got this in fact. Included lids and weights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I liked mine a lot better when I sliced it super thin with a knife. FYI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really. I dug around and found my "recipe". I actually got some of the fancy vent lids because it made it so much easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for that tiny amount of cabbage, that was probably too much salt. 1 tablespoon will do an entire jar full (a full head of cabbage).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It needs to be packed really tight. So filling that jar 3/4 or more full, packed TIGHT and yes, more salt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like it better with the randos bit, FWIW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yes, it is a process. It will take a 2 or 3 days, and then it will ebb and flow after that based on the room temp. It's kind of crazy to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How much salt? How much cabbage? How big a container?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did the actual quote involve profanity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long did you leave it? I have a great jar of homemade sauerkraut in my fridge. I'm about to buy a new head of cabbage to make a new batch to add to it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I guess the good news is that the Senate passed another $484B package today, which the house should approve Thursday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I talked to one of my cities this morning. They have one primary restaurant in their town. The owner died of COVID. The owners wife is sick with COVID. Their 16 employees are trying to carry on, but giant companies ate the safety net that was supposed to help them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying not to rage about this, but it makes me so angry. Nobody I know got either EIDL or PPP. NOBODY. And these giant companies with the their giant lawyers, finance people, and lobby people, took everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a two part problem: giant greedy companies intent on crushing small businesses and a SBAgov willing to approve them. Hell, DMC Global has a market cap of $405M and has an earnings call this week. On what planet are they a small business?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a good start on my list of places I'm never spending money at again. Giant corporations raiding the small business funds. RuthsChris is already on my list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what happens when you join the r00t0wns folding team .... foldingathome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. My sister-in-law mistook the salt canister for the sugar canister at my house one day. We COULD NOT EAT those cookies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't have any tests here to speak of really. The supply chain is broken. If you're not sick, you're not getting tested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently my state, home of both Microsoft and Amazon, has zero clue how to scale up websites and databases, nor ask for help. First the COVID database, now the entire unemployment website. Lack of imagination is a recurring theme here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd like to go the electric route, but have to make considerable upgrades to the power in my garage first. Which is going to involve digging up part of the backyard. So I will drive my current truck until it dies completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's a nurse, she's a teacher, they both worked for me part-time when I worked for the city. It's just so aweful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friend who is a healthcare worker, currently quarantined because of a possible COVID exposure to himself, had his dad pass away last night from COVID, in another state. And his mom is suffering from it. This is aweful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF am I supposed to call my sister then? It's not a word, it's her name.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No, it's a video game for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. I was panic clicking. But luckily it was awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll have to check them out if I ever manage to travel again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We clearly need shirts of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found a teeny, tiny bird nest in my tree one year made almost exclusively of my cat's fur. I try to brush him outside because FLOOF but it hadn't occurred to me that birds would love it until I found the nest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our call also featured baby goats AND big goats drinking Mt. Dew. So yeah, we could monetize that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We got the entire family on for Easter. We saw a lot of dad's thumb until he switched to the computer. Then we saw him from the nose up, like Wilson on Home Improvement. We also saw a lot of Mom's thumb on her phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. I nearly spewed coffee out my nose. This is also my life, though once I convinced that attending Zoom church was not a danger to them, it got much easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that's what my mom is making. I'm waiting for mine to arrive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the first time ever, my dad used more mobile data than I did. His phone fell off their wifi for a day ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I said the cats were bored today, apparently more bored than I thought. There's a random dust covered sock in the middle of the basement floor and a bamboo skewer on the stairs up from the basement. I have NO idea where either item came from. Either cats or the ghost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My tirade last night was started by the RuthsChris gigantic loan. My EIDL application is just out there in the ether somewhere, while the not-so-small businesses loot the system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sooooooo, I'm probably very late to this, but what is Animal Crossing and should I play it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thought! But I'm not going to give up the name. Kid should at least have a shot at privacy. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I asked this question last night. I got two yes. A barber shop in Maine and a child care facility in California. I also asked about EIDL. Nada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my insurance company so much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. this is just a Skype call. And this person has probably never used a radio! probably saw it on TV somewhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She. And I'm certain not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's somebody who is on this daily call from time to time who ends there report with "OVER". I find it hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In very important news, I found out that the new family offspring is going to be a niece! And she already has a lovely name. It's a flower. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha! He was bored earlier and wandered around the house interrupting conference calls.. Now he's napping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't follow everyone. But you do science, so I now follow you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no idea what's going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, that's what I buy for mine. Though they'll eat bread, bird food, suet blocks, veggies, whatever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too! Sometimes I'll have 40 of them in my yard. If I leave out good treats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a brave yard crow. Probably a female who's making a nest. She didn't fly away when I went out, so I came in and got a handful of peanuts for her. She did not call for her friends. Kept them all for herself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of them. Government isn't big on remote work. Some of the consulting gigs might be, but likely not. They involve a lot of actual paperwork.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're holding steady. No drop yet, but a very flat curve. We've been able to send resources to help others states that didn't implement stay home orders as early as we did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. I know some who have their resignations already written.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah, it's the received funds part I'm interested in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. My application for EIDL is somewhere in the ether.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is gone, unless congress puts more in the pot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think maybe we all need this mug, now that the entire world is in conference call hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was it PPP or EIDL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ruth's Chris Steakhouse got a shit ton of money. Nobody in my circle of small businesses have gotten a dime and most can't even get their applications processed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that $405 or $4.05? unparsable number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone have firsthand knowledge of ANY small business that successfully received EIDL or PPP money before it ran out? I don't. I've checked around. Where did all that money actually go?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know why we never got a toaster oven before this. Fast yummy things keep coming out of it. brindisi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because the banks are robbing us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most epic video I've seen today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The college I work for has extended wifi into some of their parking areas, so that students and faculty who don't have internet at home can sit in their cars and get online. They ran out of loaner laptops and mifis, so this is the next option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And cities like Vegas need to be very mindful of how they reopen. They become the hub for new infections across the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. Their published reasoning is a month old tho, so I'm operating under the "grace" clause. There's just a lot going on. I think large events in most places will be cancelled at least until fall, but the details can be tricky. Esp w/Vegas venues who are booking again for 6/1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I started my day with a stroofwafel and coffee. And then hubby brought me a little cup of Starbucks molten lava latte or something equally ridiculous. It was sooooooo good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES! We're out though and our store had none on the last grocery expedition we did. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, I feel like defcon has been pretty transparent with their process and thinking. The insurance thing is a bugger though. A lot of event policies have "disease" exclusions that leave orgs on the hook unless the venue is closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know. But when I worked in an office, I was grateful that our org had a "no strong scents" policy. I cannot deal with perfume or the cologne (or that damned Axe body spray dudes are so fond of).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to watch this weather forecast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know of 4 who have voluntarily left (though 3 stayed in EM and went to another agency) and at least 8 who intend to leave, some for any other career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a lot of it will be due to pissed off emergency managers leaving for new careers. I've talked to so many who have been cut out by their organizations, in favor of "winging it" instead of drawing from existing plans and training.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The joys of Teams. Somebody has been bitching about a team that doesn't exist. Except it turns out it does. It's associated group has been deleted (forever) and the team has no owner. I'm sure this will be easy to fix ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a DMB fan. This is one of my fav songs. I'm SO EXCITED he did the long lost 3rd verse! It's been 17 years or something crazy like that! greystreet dmb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. I had someone super frustrated last night trying to login to a system. They were all "YOU NEED TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE INSTRUCTIONS". I read the instructions this morning. That part was clearly there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one finally got started. And it's good. The issue was mostly people who refuse to read instructions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting here on a webinar that I *paid* to be on (training class) and it's 13 minutes past start time and other people's technical difficulties are keeping us from starting. Not cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, that was yesterday. You missed it. Now you have to wait until tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've been talking about/planning for recovery for a month. It's hard to get started though. Everybody is kind of doing their own thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's outside beer time! Thanks tavour for nibrewing beer!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What?? That's amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what much of Asia has done for years. It's only new in Western cultures. It has a bonus upside of also messing with facial recognition cameras.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It could be, but even here we're struggling with food issues. Food banks are overwhelmed, they've had huge upticks in use, combined with huge drops in volunteers and donations. We're using the National Guard to help several of them. We're beyond what govt can directly support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to have an emergency root canal three weeks ago. That was fun ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other very important news, my nephew bought a school bus to convert into an RV. We are now lobbying for a family road trip in the bus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's only partially true. If the meal is for a private business, like a hospital, it would not be reimbursable, regardless of who orders it. And the rules for non-profit hospitals are such that even they might not get reimbursed for it. Ditto schools trying to feed kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly, Ravn just shut down and filed for Chapter 11. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so quiet in my office this morning! I realized it's because my foldingathome client has no work to do. Fans are all at idle ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are. Huge ones. We already have fire departments taking engines out of service to try to avoid the layoffs that are likely to happen. Portland has laid off 950 employees. The lost tax revenue is not reimbursable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sizing and washing become a huge issue. Which makes them far more expensive in the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look what came? Mmmmm stroopwafel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is to say that I've not found anything better than vests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You get to work/train with a handful of people, but turnover is too high for people to actually know each other. Plus in large or long-term incidents, you supplement with people who have never been there before, both internal and external. And you can't stay at your desk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mission accomplished..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, I do not clean. I pick up clutter so she can actually clean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our cleaning lady is still coming tomorrow I think and I don't want to leave it for her. And I'd like her to be able to clean the floor under it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'ts this one:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing. It makes the best quesadillas ever! And husband quit bitching about our horrible toaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a toaster oven that isn't an air fryer, but all the reviews said it worked like one. they were right. It is amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a Watch friend, not a Warning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nada around my house. I teach my neighbors to shut their location data off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I failed at the screen capture. But there were dogs, cats, goats [drinking Mt. Dew], the sound of somebody's turkeys, guns, more cats, and the whole family except for one brother. It was a good time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost time for family Easter Zoom. This should be entertaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took some bird pictures when I was in Hawaii for work, right before QuarantineLife started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg there are so many choices on their website! Who knew!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found a tiny bottle of stroopwafel liquor on my shelf. Now it's in my coffee. Yum! And now I want actual DaelmansStroop stroopwafels. Luckily they have a website ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bought stamps online. Yes, I still have to mail things like invoices to some companies. And some of them mail me checks. Yes, I know it's 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had no questions from my teams! I think it's because I put on my professor hat and wrote detailed notes for almost every rejection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just spent 7 hours as a TraceLabs OSINT CTF judge. So fun! Also, exhausting. Contestants definitely found some solid leads!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Somebody did this in our neighborhood last year, without a permit. They had thousands of people show up, who overran our neighborhood.

<|startoftext|>I'll have mine up loud, so no worries! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're going to do great! I did my first one at Defcon last year. I was so happy with how I did! I was a team of one, but my points were the same as the average of the winning team. I'm also a numbers nerd ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a judge this time. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you doing the Trace Labs CTF??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My quarantine project has been to catalog my hockey card collection. I just passed through 20,000 cards and I have more boxes to go. Most of these are pre-1995. I have some super rad rookie cards from the early 80s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least we won't run out of beer thanks to tavour and UPS. QuarantineLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That nearly caused me to shoot very good beer out my nose!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our recycle bin cannot keep up with QuarantineLife but Butters is excited for each new fort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see what you did there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Facebook has never really had a way to search for geolocated stuff. You can find it on public posts sometimes, but if people are taking their security seriously, they're limiting who can see their posts to only their friends.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hope they have babies in my yard again this year. So freaking cute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, i've got trash pandas on the security cams, but it's really not the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other words, I just want to see more water critter videos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were going to Disneyland one month from today, just to see the Star Wars stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitive proof would be the critter sitting on the ground with his full tail on display. Or a video of him entering/leaving a beaver lodge. Or chewing down a tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear god, who are these people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My health system sent a message through their patient portal. And everybody tried to read it and crashed the system. I read it 2 days later when I could finally get in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shockingly none! I was actually expecting a phone call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dad has successfully watched the video (!) and decisively declared beaver. And be decisive, he sent one word. Via text (!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody missed curfew last night. urbanwildlife trashpanda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That video is my happy place for today btw. The birds, the water critter, very happy place. Though a raccoon just bolted across my lawn and up a tree, so that makes me happy too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll download a copy and send it to him. He's not so great with the interwebs ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has it been mowing down trees too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beavers have a really wide tail, which is what that looks like in the video. Muskrats have a tail today looks like a rat. Then there are nutria, which have a rat tail also. A beaver will slap the water with that wide tail to indicate danger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not sure how this is comfy, but clearly it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It took me 10 times as long to install and configure then it did to actually perform the nuking!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Props to AlaskaAir for extending status expirations and lounge memberships. Eventually I have to spend down that $3300 I have in canceled flights ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only saving grace for part of this is that one of my schools is term based, so they raced through the end of the last term, which gave a little leeway to get this one started. All my classes were already online, but now I'm an online faculty mentor too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's unnerving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's been one taking walkies by our house. It occasionally stops and does rollies in our yard. The accompanying humans are powerless to stop it. Which is fine with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have specially made prescription glasses for computer work that account for the distance from my nose to the monitor, my need for multifocal lenses, and my astigmatism. Plus they have anti-glare coating. I just have to adjust to the new monitor distance and height.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm actually sort of surprised that SECNAV got off that ship in once piece.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad used to be a fur trapper. I have up close and personal knowledge of the difference, since they would sit around our woodstove drying on boards. And yes, my childhood was very, very strange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The current issue seems to be that even when states are trying to buy their own, they're getting diverted into the federal stockpile, which is then inaccessible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It looks mildly uncomfortable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally agree. My point was the only reason they're doing anything at all is CMS. I have friends who got hired in healthcare EM jobs and didn't stay long because the org wouldn't spend money on anything that was non-billable. Our healthcare system is broken in many ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The joint commission EM rules are pretty much a joke. The CMS rules are better and have teeth, but they're in their infancy of being implemented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the masks I've been are non viable. The face shields are pretty good if you have access to mylar sheets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, I don't think there was much of a plan. And if the was the plan, it didn't account for the gutting of the SNS. Another thought: hospitals had to be forced to even do EM..CMS rules only started requiring that about 3 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It. is. the. best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hospitals run on such a thin margin, they rely almost exclusively on JIT delivery. We always knew that JIT would kick us all in the ass eventually. And here we are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just checked out the actual Esri COVID board in WebEOC. It has some amazing county-by-county infographics, including info on home many homes have Internet, use SNAP, and other data. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll walk this back a tiny bit. At some point that board name change and it's now COVID Jurvare Dashboard. There's a different COVID ESRI Dahsboard with different info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of it is working fine, which is what makes it weird. The States by cases panel (first image) is wrong. When you drill down to the specific state, it's correct. Or as correct as it can be at any given time. You can see the Washington discrepancy here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, it's just in our instance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a 17. I've never lived in the south. My great-grandparents did though. I guess some of this passed on down the line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish the Esri COVID dashboard on juvarecorp WebEOC was consistent. It looks like the states quit refreshing at some point, though the total numbers did not. A dashboard is only useful if it's consistent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some dingleberry sales guy from electroNeek just e-mailed me to tell me he'll be in my city next week and wants to grab a coffee. Me: you're not an essential employee. Coming here would be a gross misdemeanor. All coffee shops are closed. I strongly encourage you not to come.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of our city EOCs is all virtual right now. I popped in to say hi and somebody asked if Butters could join us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Butters routinely pops in on my calls. My husband is 100% remote and has been since November. Apparently the small cat made her first appearence on one of his calls this week. And everyone was super excited to know he had a cat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a cockatiel that joins it's human mom on our daily conference call with all the cities. Whatever bad news we're going to hear is tempered by either the sight or sound of the bird. I honestly look forward to it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just for one metro area. It shows the desperation of the medical system that is running it. They should not have to do that, but they are out of anything resembling a suitable alternative.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here's the thing. We can demand all day, but we have nowhere to buy PPE. One of the Seattle hospitals recruited people with sewing machines to make masks for them out of materials they provided. Hospital in my city thought they might run out by tomorrow. And they can't get more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I checked closer on where you were after I chimed and was like "ohhhhhh, Illinois"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's probably true in the weirdness that is Illinois. Many states are completely home rule from the get go and it's built into their constitution. Illinois is a Dillon's rule/home rule hybrid, where cities can be home rule if they so declare.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That is not true Dani. Local public officials in most states have the ability to enact stricter measures in their own communities than the state may choose (or need) to do.

<|startoftext|>My health provider sent out a blast message last night to all their portal users. This has been the message since then. Lots of places struggling to keep systems up that were never expected to see such heavy demand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Message from InfraGardNatl to go check our privacy settings. I guess it's pretty private ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread made me giggle. "big flap on wing make plane go up"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting in my downstairs home office. Can hear a cat that clearly isn't mine. It's coming from the conference call my husband is on in his upstairs home office. CatsMakeEverythingBetter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp, now that's official. All my remote contract work is gone until June. this is probably an excellent time to volunteer to foster kittens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because we turned down the WHO tests, then screwed up the ones we made on our own and sent out. And we don't have national healthcare, so there's no coordinated way to send them, administer them, and process them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once it's endemic, have to assume everybody has it. And we need the limited amounts of tests available for first responders, healthcare providers, and actual sick people. If we had enough tests for everybody, it would be different. We don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My coworker was also sleeping on the job. Which did NOT prevent him from farting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to rehang these on my wall today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Somebody found the sunbeam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hospital in my city, on the news this morning:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area emergency management job with WA EMD as a Public Assistance Program Delivery Manager (multiple openings). EMjobs EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe. She might just not know. I'll find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Mom is sick. Probably strep. Her primary care provider moved away. The clinic now treats her as a new patient and can't get her in for 3 months. Urgent cares near them are all closed down. Suggested video doc, but Medicare might not pay for it. Our system sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not frustrated by them. At all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here was the first attempt yesterday. Note that people drove 200 miles to an area with wide community spread to try to get tested. This is unhelpful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I totally agree that if your medical provider and public health say you should get tested, you should. But we've told people they should stay home. And how the feds are telling them to drive out and get tested. It's frustrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I'm coming at it from a point of view that our community is not doing general testing of the public, for a variety of reasons that were decided by public health, but now we're going to have it forced upon us by the feds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Professor Sassy Mittens. And I wholly approve!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not talking about home tests. I'm talking about everybody mobbing to drive-thru test facilities, which are staffed by people using critical PPE that could be used for something else. I have far less issue with home testing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only to a point though. We *really* need those supplies for other things right now. And if people are going to get tested multiple times to see when they finally get it, that's going to take even more that we don't have. The best decision right now is to save lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All those supplies and PPE required for testing could be used by healthcare providers trying to save lives right now. T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we talk about COVID testing for a minute? I know people really want to get tested, but what's the exact point? The test tells you if you have now, not if you had it two weeks ago or might have it tomorrow. And if you do have it, there's no treatment. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On a totally (or not quite) unrelated topic to everything else, I need a new toaster. Apparently my husband hates ours and now I get to hear about it every day. Tell me about your favorite toaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PH quit doing it here simply because they don't have the staffing to keep it up and there are so many cases that it's impossible to do tracebacks on them. They started out doing it, then quickly became overwhelmed and had to stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did a press interview yesterday with my EM hat on. She asked "when did you know that everything had changed" I was like "which time?".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I described my LinkedIn yesterday as mostly me swatting away people who wanted to sell me something for "response".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For our hybrid classes, we're doing synchronous learning, which does require a butt to be in a seat at a certain time. We're hoping that helps, but<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily, all my classes were on-line or hybrid this term, so no changes, except we waived the classroom requirements for hybrid. We worry about the impact that will have on our VA funded students though. They might losing housing allowance dollars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, it's already too late. We still need to do it, but the lack of PPE is past the point of alarming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The system is HAMMERING me to encourage my students to complete evals. I'm getting right on that, ftr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every article I've read about this, including one from this morning, said the rates were supposed to be set at zero and the monthly payments were supposed to remain the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got all the updates this morning from Navient on my student loans. They ADDED 5 years to life of one of my loans. They reduced the payments on the others, which was not what I read was supposed to happen. I'm just going to keep paying what I was and enjoy the zero interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure as long as we also agree to do our homework and find out why something happened when that information is readily available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it was. They have already stated it was their issue and mistake. I get the need to try to stop misinformation, but they needed more him humans on the task.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is so true. Like seriously, why do I need to hear this from the online company I bought a swimsuit from once??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cleaning lady's price just went up. Good for her! She also arrived locked and loaded to kill any germ that might exist in my house. And she has a large supply.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've lost $8000 in contracts in the next 4 weeks. Luckily my primary contract, and my part-time gig that provides health insurance, remain intact. My baby brother has lost all paid work through April, has no health insurance, and has a baby on the way. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. I have tears running down my face from laughing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just had convo with EM colleague about high need for remote mental health services right now. People with jobs can access their EAPs, but a lot of them may not have remote access. We were thinking that chat/phone/video mental health services should be covered in a disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It looks like the data may be here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mostly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mute, mute, mute your phone, gently on the line, merrily, merrily, merrily merrily, we will be just fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes please. Local first responders are already out of some types of PPE and cannot get more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the perfect autocorrect btw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The raw daily data by state for the PPP tracker?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have the raw data for this??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This might have something useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure some enterprising data nerd has been grabbing them, but I don't know who that would be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh, I get it. You'd have to compile yourself from the daily updates. Nobody is publishing it in that form that I'm aware of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The DOH website is the more accurate, though it has a lag time as counties report in at different times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately, the statistics tell us that 40% of businesses don't reopen after a disaster. of those that do, if they've been closed (or lost revenue) for 5 or more days, 90% will fail within a year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Problem is that many small schools don't really have infosec and are more or less winging it. Luckily both schools I work for pre-authorized Zoom a long time ago. But one of them I'm pretty sure never considered FERPA in any meaninfgul way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have partially solved the mystery of the corn. In talking with my dad tonight, he mentioned he has 40 or 50 cans of canned corn. That's an alarming amount of corn!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If I pay as schedule, I'll be done in my early 60s. I'm trying to pay well ahead of schedule, but life keeps happening. First the 15 month layoff for the other half, now all the lost contracts due to a certain virus. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me, wondering about this whole student loan interest waiver. Apparently Navient is wondering too. And their login is down. You can look, but you can't touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make sure the bird has plenty of food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check with the small, non-chain markets in your area. I popped into one of our mom & pop markets yesterday and they were completely stocked with everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should qualify as a ADA accommodation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought that was odd. But I'm the family genealogist, so they got a fairly precise mix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just did in fact. I'm on the phone with them right now and they finally got their policies caught up with reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW, it totally was a Stafford Act dec. I *thought* it was going to be the other kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this was an accidental example of how a virus spreads. And how once you get it, there's no cure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cat way ok with hearing about it. She immediately went to wash her paws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hilariously, at my brother's grocery store, ALL the canned corn was gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, that's what weary man also told me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7 hours after the scheduled time, a very weary sounding man called to say my order was ready. I just picked up and he looks as weary as he sounded. I appreciate not having to shop!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ordered groceries yesterday from Fred_Meyer for pickup at noon today. At 11, they called to say they were running several hours behind and it would probably be 4 or 5 before they were ready. It's now 6. No groceries yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tiny piece of cool news. chemeketa, where I got my associates degree forever ago, solicited 50 word "essays" on people's experiences there. Mine got selected for publication!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Emergency declaration coming, but disaster declaration. Significant difference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had an interesting thing pop up in one of my cities today though. Someone with a pre-existing condition that puts them at high risk needed to invoke ADA for a public facing job. It became an accommodation request that is being honored.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Try living in Seattle. We're in information overload.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're actively working the childcare issues here in WA. And like everything else related to this, we're figuring it out as we go. It's complicated, but necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm mildly amused by the fact that when people in my circles are questioning the wisdom of the scientists who are advising to cancel stuff, they are being bombarded by FlattenTheCurve<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's located in Vegas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. So RCI_Timeshare's policy is that they want sick people to travel to their resorts in the United States. At least that's my take, given that they won't issue refunds to people travelling from Seattle. Good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of ours are at very minimal staffing or entirely virtual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're still trying to convince people this is even an issue though. Showing hard numbers can help with that. AND there are a large number of people who have it, don't have symptoms, and are wandering around spreading it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The issue is that isn't enough time to evaluate, due to the incubation period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not crazy. The virus is endemic and the only way to slow transmission is to limit exposure to other people. Look at Italy right now. Same deal. Though we are very late to implement these measures. Two weeks is not enough eval time since incubation can be that long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you moved into a bubble?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was on a video call with colleagues and they asked if ButtersOK was around to join us. I couldn't find him at the time. Pets do make working from home awesome. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pretty sure this is his favorite song..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear NHLSeattle_, please hire SeattleTbirds DancingUsher. He's ready for the big leagues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should be something. What was he even doing down here when literally everyone had been sent to their corners?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what happens when you get Iverson and Ingram.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uhhhhhhhh, somehow the pdxwinterhawks backup goalie ended up on the wrong end of the ice after that fracas and gave one of the SeattleTbirds sticks to a fan. Hockey mom retrieved it and got it to an official.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bauer with the hair flip and the send off wave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That good enough??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was it my imagination or did that Portland player jump into the photo box instead of the player box and have to get back without touching the ice??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot how much I dislike the ShoWareCenter fish sandwich. It's a pain to eat and the tartar sauce is terrible..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So maybe Ingram and Iverson somehow cancel each other out???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I turn around and helpfully explain hockey to people who are super annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love these stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many things can you find wrong in this image?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Savannah, they go right by the convention center window. It makes you think the building is moving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! I pull up the ship traffic apps to see where they're coming from or going to. Watching them in places like New Orleans, Savannah or Port Huron is even more cool! Giant ships in tiny waterways. I have a friend who is taking a "cruise" on a cargo ship soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arlo: there's a dog in the yard Arlo: there's a person in the yard chasing the dog Butters: THERE'S A DOG IN THE YARD. OMG. OMG. OMG. Me: hi lady in my yard chasing a dog. Do you need help? Lady: *running after dog* no, I think I'm ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get Russian ads when I use iVPN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I teach it as a graduate class and I have a paper co-authored and pending publication. Do EM and cybersecurity and it applies equally to both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And what we teach PIOs and other communicators doesn't account for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of this difficulty is the role of cognitive dissonance. We're telling people things that are counter to what they believe to be true. Until they find a reason to set aside those beliefs and replace them with actual facts, they won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perception is reality for everybody. Our task is to change their perception to one that is a accurate and useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was very pleased with it! I was even more pleased that Shutterfly reprinted it for free after the porch pirate took it..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a whole lecture on risk perception in here, but I'm too tired to give it tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Partly because people call all kinds of things the flu that aren't. So they really don't understand how bad and deadly the actual influenza virus is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the quality gin infused content I'm here for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahahahaha!! Butters snuck into the pantry when I had it open. Then he got locked in, but was too dumb to meow. After realizing he was missing, I went looking and there he was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thai bhat maybe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, this explains the issue I just started troubleshooting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We already had to put a new latch on the pantry. It's his favorite napping spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So ButtersOK loves to chew on plastic. Just chew, not eat. He has figured out where we store the Ziploc bags. He walks into the kitchen, opens the drawer, and gets a bag. He doesn't even try to be stealthy about it. LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is that this is the same public who refuses flu and measles vaccines. They won't protect themselves from something that is 100% preventable that they are already at risk from. I have little hope that the public will make the effort to save themselves from this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Porch pirate took a fancy looking package off my porch at Christmas. I'm hoping he was thrilled with the 8x10 portrait of a blue footed boobie. This one in fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was very fond of our last policy. I'm glad I have a policy now, but I'm not happy that I had to abandon the pharmacy I had used for 15 years and I'm unhappy that one of my fav providers isn't covered now. I have to pay out of pocket if I want to see her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please report this to your security people so they can alert people. I've been on hold for more than 10 minutes and can't get through to anybody. My called ID said Puget Sound Energy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got a call from PSETalk saying my service was being cut off due to non-payment. Knew it was a scam, but stayed on the line.

<|startoftext|>I'll share one I just watched a few weeks ago. Two Native American women presenting about how tribes work and relate to other government entities. A man, not a tribal member, piped up, not with a question, but to tell them how some other tribe should run their enterprises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got asked to host a booth on cyber privacy and cyber bullying at a school next month. I'm so excited! I'm digging through violetblue and BadassBowden tweets and resources for inspiration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm late to this, but your professor had no right to do that. What he should have done was offer to support you and assist you in finding support services from the school, if you were interested in them. Or option B, keep his mouth shut.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>62 hours of time volunteered in 5 days for SKCClinic. Every part of me aches, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Helping 3000 people access free healthcare is a truly amazing experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I assume it's some dumb American who thinks we arbitrarily changed the Canadian national anthem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Day 1 of SKCClinic in the books! 1) my fitness tracker wants to know what happened to it's real mom; 2) most of these steps occurred in about a 60 x 20 foot area.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>TFW the meeting you were going to bail on anyway gets cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mostly unrelated, but one of my students in live call referred to "The Who" and my brain absolutely could not figure out what a 60s rock band had to do with anything. Then I realized she was talking about "the WHO" and had probably never heard of "The Who". FeelingOld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a most unpleasant tech support experience. The woman lectured me that my use of a password manager was "my problem" and whatevered me when I told that was incorrect. And she can't explain why my account was locked out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good. My first team was Portland. Had season tickets there from 90 or 91 until end of the 96/97 season. Then we moved up here and I COULD NOT be a Seattle fan. EVT was our buffer team. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth. We were inaugural season ticket holders in Everett and stayed until Showare was built. Now, ick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exciting news. Army nephew finally got to see a real Army doctor, 6 weeks after separating his shoulder. Real doctor said WTF and sent him to an ortho. FINALLY! It would be nice if he didn't have to spend the rest of his life gimpy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I worry about identity theft. Or any number of other things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you know more about what's going on in my state than I do???? Thanks though. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to do more digging. The union got a court injunction, so that people who are survivors of domestic violence, sexual harassment, or stalking can opt out. But our stupid law doesn't let the rest of opt it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not even a dues paying union member as a part-time faculty. But that union got me health insurance. I WOULD pay them if I were eligible. HEALTH INSURANCE for a part-time employee, because it's in the blessed contract.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sent my first one to them, then I got schooled. And I can't remember the name of the second one. It might be Wigs for Kids. In any case, it's a good use of hair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. I teach for a public college. Some outfit called the Freedom Foundation has requested all employees name/dob/work locations/work e-mail address. There is nothing I can do under the law to stop them. Their intent is to harass us until we dissolve our union. NotFreedom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call yourself a hair farmer and donate it to Locks of Love or a similar organization. My sis and I have both done it twice. It's as good an excuse as any to chop your hair off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, what??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should have clarified. The presentation wasn't asked for by the IT department. I'm used to that. This was asked for by another department. I always happy to have the IT people there. Just usually surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always odd to me when I do a cybersecurity presentation and the entire IT department, including the Director, attends. I'm glad they're there, but they should have something setup to get that job done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun times. That last one is about increased landslide risk.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In classic Seattle style today, NWSSeattle changed their forecast to snow when they looked outside and it was indeed snowing. I tease because I love!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you won't prepare unless you perceive an actual risk to yourself, people you care about, or your pets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most first responder orgs don't fully implement ICS that often. They struggle once they get into a second ops period. They never train for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we do things like "combo classes", which take the key concepts of 100, 200, 700 and cram them into 6 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had convo with someone last week where they are starting to change this, at least for key players. They will no longer accept the FEMA online ICS training certs, in lieu of a state offered in-class one with practical application.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See my other comment. Plus, the actual required training is too short and doesn't include appropriate activities. And our organizations fight is on that. To do it right takes more time than they're willing to spend on it. At the end of the day, it's just not a priority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My biggest issue as a city EM was staff turnover. We couldn't do exercised that built on the last ones because we had new people every time. The multi-year exercise plan for us never got beyond basics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's something unlikely to ever be solved. Most people who take an ICS class (because they are required to), will never end up using it on a large scale event where it actually matters. And so we have a steady stream of non-proficient people trying to implement a system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your Princess Bride quotes will be gotten by me all day. Bring them on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Healthcare has also tweaked it and calls it HICS. And part of the reason ICS struggles is because EOCs and similar things try to implement it and it was never designed for that. It's for incident response, not incident support.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It also looks that way as an emergency manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's sort of what I've been thinking as well. I look at our federal agencies and they've been gutted. HHS/ASPR is doing ok, but they're now supporting all the re-entry screening sites plus the repatriation quarantine site. There are only so many resources to go around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently this is some sort of secret troll bait. InsultAndRun<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What are you sorry for? And to be clear, these are people who were stationery, with their backs to me. They can't see me, and I don't want them to back up and crash into me. Maybe it's because I owned a restaurant and it's a common practice there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get that. But when you're not expecting them to do anything, what would I be asking to be be excused for? Excuse me makes sense if they need to do something. If they don't, it doesn't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The ones I hung around were mostly chicken farmers. They were lovely people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do use "make a hole" as well, if the movement is retired required more urgently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to a Mennonite grade school. This boggles my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seriously can't figure out why it's offensive..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, you're on campus??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I horribly offended someone today by saying "behind" as I walked behind them. I actually said it as I walked behind several people. One was offended because I didn't say "excuse me". I say excuse me when I need someone to move. I say behind when I'm warning someone I'm there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It was your turn. We have to rotate so our heads don't explode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every Sunday after church we had to go to my abusers house. For my 16th birthday, he bought our family a piano that I got to see every day. It's still in my house 30 years later.

<|startoftext|>Also, if you want to be a guest speaker to talk about how research methodologies could be incorporated into AARs, consider this a standing invitation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don't! It's the hardest class they take in our program. Not because it was designed to be hard, but because almost none of them have had any exposure to research. Something I'm trying to change throughout the program so they're not so overwhelmed when they get here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FEMA has a model class for a Bachelor's degree on research methods. Guess what I'm teaching to a bunch of seniors in EM this term? Research methods. Because it's important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would venture that's partially because EMs don't know how to do that kind of writing. Teaching in the Advanced Academy, people routinely freak out about the research paper that requires methodologies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The meaning comes from the improvement plan and buy-in for that plan. That becomes the hard part. It requires executive level support to make it happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The primary purpose seems to be to check a box. Most are never read again and the improvements never happen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now is a good time to remind people to verify the photos they're seeing online.

<|startoftext|>Great thread. Government never ends up with the best. For all the reasons in this thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were in the air well before that posted delay time. Strange day at ATL I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is odd AlaskaAir. After all this dither, a delay popped up after the boarding door closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're now at 8 minutes late. And finally closed the door. Whew! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my. Now that's a gate agent on the plane, trying to sort out some sort of seat debacle. And I guess the lady who bolted isn't coming back. They just upgraded someone to get seat.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Only in Alabama would there be an argument about how many syllables are in orange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We came out of our hotel in Alabama and this guy was playing the pipes in the pouring rain. We have no idea why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Case in point: small city near me hired a new EM with experience in something sort of related. No education, tiny bit of training. Had to explain last week why the tiny landslide they had last week had zero chance of reimbursement. Person hired had zero understanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think part of this argument is based on the idea that emergency response experience is the same as emergency management experience, when it is not. EM is the admin function that supports response. You have to learn to do research, write reports, write plans, write grants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been having this argument for 20 years. It's old. Experienced emergency managers are the only people who get to apply for jobs based on experience. If we only hire people with experience, eventually we'll run out of people. Education combined with an internship are how you get in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big shout out to Victorinox for replacing my broken wheel, even though I have no idea where my receipt is!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Welcome to the redheads who don't wear makeup family!! (My profile pic in an anomaly)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem lies in that many parts of the country don't have any entry level jobs. A lot of them are one or two person shops and whomever gets hired had to know how to do everything since there's nobody to show them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landed in it. Left it. In Bham until Monday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! The group text message just came back to life. It won't die . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the seat is clean, but soaking wet now. But we're going anyway. Thankfully not my seat!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they just called for two more people to help with cleanup. I just saw a giant frappaccino cup go buy, so Starbucks may be too blame for this Delta delay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should be taking off now, but cabin services just boarded to clean up a spill of some sort. We may never get to Birmingham at this rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Delta flight is so cramped! I can barely get my backpack under the seat. Hubby couldn't get his to fit at all. And if the guy in front of hubby tries to put his seat back, there's going to be an issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not off to a good start for 2020 AlaskaAir. Flight to ATL cancelled for crew rest. Choices were red eye or switch to Delta and still get there today. Went from row 1 to 26 and 42 respectively. Sad day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of those reviews though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sounds horrific. And I apparently managed to avoid it as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have to buy that special "all-in-one" that washes everything. Hair and bodies should not be washed with the same product!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was straight-up my Granny. They finally kicked her out of hospice. :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's where he's stationed. That's where he'll see a specialist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just checked. That info came from the Tricare hotline. I told him to call again and at least get them to ok pain meds.<|endoftext|>

Hardest task was to convince them to let me go home instead of staying in the hotel they paid for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were about six different knobs on this shower. Turns out two of them were actually buttons. That was the secret.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know. Like, I should not have to ask how a shower works. I'm a grown-ass adult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha! I had such a confusing hotel shower this year I had to call the front desk and they had to send a facility guy to show me how it worked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Do I even want to know why??? Ironically, I'm going there to teach a winter weather class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: I'm going to travel less this year. Work Schedule: 7 trips to DC, 4 to Vegas, 1 to Hawaii, 1 to Spokane, 1 to Reno. Personal: 1 to Atlanta, 1 to California. Plus extended overnight trips to both Seattle and Bellevue for volunteer activities. All that before October.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suddenly understand why my nephew doesn't want to reenlist in the army. He seperated his shoulder on HBL. 3 days ago. ER gave him 5 days of painkillers and told him to get to a specialist. Army said no civilian treatment and no specialist until 1/9. So he's just SOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our healthcare system sucks. Now I need to see a specialist for something. Clinic full of specialists. Only one will accept me for this issue. Appointment is more than a month out. And oops, she's not covered by my insurance so I have to cancel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a work trip to a fairly remote place in January. The nicest looking hotel option is someplace called the Antler Motel. It took me 5 phone calls to make a reservation because the office is open very limited hours. I'm definitely taking my silk sleep sack for this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was one of the nice things about working for a small agency. We always got closure, even if it was unpleasant. I hope you get to know the outcome and that it's positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meeting you was one of the highlights of my year. Thanks for being awesome! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. QuickenOfficial is updating sooooooooo slow this morning. I have end of year stuff to do. Hurry up!! It also annoyingly slows down my entire computer to the point it's barely usable. Though it shows less than 10% of CPU ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tweet about disasters, emergency management, some infosec stuff, a little OSINT, a lot of cats, passionately about hockey. I plan to tweet a lot more about risk and risk perception in 2020. It has direct ties to all of that except hockey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate, hate, hate the word rape being used for anything other than a physical rape. I try to speak up (or post up) when I see it happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm kinda sad I already watched all the new ExpanseOnPrime episodes. I tried to ration them and failed. Maybe I'll just watch them again. TheExpanse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I came here looking specifically for kitten updates. This does not disappoint. Might I suggest some tuna pudding for the wee scaredy cat? It's vile. But even the cat who hates me will accept this treat from me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always say I don't make New Years resolutions. I'll make an exception this year. Drinking more water is an outstanding idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Seahawks, this is not the game we were looking for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have goals for 2020: more writing things I want to write, more taking pictures, more singing, more OSINT stuff (with TraceLabs mostly), and DefconProm attendance. These are all realistic and achievable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the side benefits of traveling so much is a donation of 656 travel toiletries I've collected going to the local food bank. They also run our local homeless outreach and day center. frequentflyer travel DoGood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The horrible project I didn't want to do is done. Along with a note that says "you gave me half the hours, so you got half-ass work".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can do stats all day long! I even teach research methods now to undergrads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole thing resonates, for mostly opposite reasons. We got yanked from school when I was in the third grade. As an adult, I finally figured out I could have actually maybe learned math if given the opportunity (pre-internet). Mom is still shocked when I do something cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been into it for more than 30 years! I still have my original SLR camera. But I realized this year that I really enjoy stalking wildlife and I want to do more of that. Plus annoying the cat. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Washington Supreme Court had to actual rule this past week and make "using your turn signal is required" a supreme court decision. That says everything about our horrible driving ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW, I love your photos. Even though I don't comment very often, I love them. I follow you because of hockey, but the rest have inspired me to up my photo hobby. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the quality content I follow you for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to borrow this and share it with my local goat rescue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I spoke a little too soon. Another one popped up. This might be a game of whack-a-troll for a couple of days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are days I truly hate social media. Today is one of those days. On the plus side, I have plenty of whiskey. And the horrible people were held accountable for their actions. Hopefully they've all crawled back under their rocks and will stay there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is Pixel and she is judging me and you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all still there I think. Like 6 tweets from that account, mostly screen caps from a private FB group..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I disagree. Tiny cat is adorable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or my giant floof ButtersOK? Though he does not disappoint in the cuddles department.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The FB group admin not only booted them and their spouses but reported them for TOS violation. I'm impressed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And another update: Twitter has already locked that account out. If they delete there offending tweets, they can come back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you look at their whole thread? It's even goofier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trolls being trolls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The admin of the FB group already has figured out who it is. And Twitter has already contacted me directly about my harassment report. I'm about to enjoyed a hockey game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In so, so many ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: I now hate my local buy nothing group. I asked the wrong question and some halfwit did this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the part about where I tried to find their owners and they don't have collars means nothing to you. Nice. N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a college professor, I make all of my exams open book and non-proctored. There's not enough time to look everything up and life isn't about rote memorization. It's about knowing where to find the answers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, this. Except I moved it around to show that my desk looks like a dumpster. The hotel room one was much cleaner. I gave them strongly worded feedback about this. After I passed the test ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took one once that required a web cam. Fine. Logged in to take the exam from a hotel room on my Surface. It required a stand-alone webcam, not an integrated one. I got lucky, since there were still other time slots. I ended up taking it at 1 AM after I got home from my trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm munching on chips and salsa right now for this very reason. It's not really helping me write, but my brain quit screaming about a snak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How awful. I can't even imagine. I worked in 911 way back in the day, before this (or much of the internet) was a thing. Then we couldn't send help because we didn't know where people were. Now they have the opposite problem. Glad you and your dad are ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kind of imagine him looking like this when he grows up. Doom fits ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes please! Our outfits are ready!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They haven't even started talking about pricing for non-club seats. I would say it's really just a rumor. That said, given that they have deposits for twice as many actual seats than they have, that would be a way to whittle it down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, which is the only downside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's much tinier than I expected from BadassBowden's original photo of him! Sooooo cute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is the week I get a live trap and start collecting cats for the humane society. I'm tired of my things getting destroyed because other people are irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So ButtersOK just destroyed one of my living room window blinds because of the damned stray cat in our yard. I think he remembers the time he was able to get out that window (by smashing through the screen like Kool Aid Man) and go after an interloper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I joined my local Buy Nothing group. I was worried it would be an odd place. It turns out I rather like it. I've gotten rid of things that I don't want/need/use and they're now in the hands of people who want/need/use them. It's rather lovely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That project that was due yesterday, that I hate and don't want to do? Still working on it. And apparently at least one of my colleagues also hates it. Neither of us want our names associated with it and regret having signed on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've found that cats often tell you what their names are after a few days. Also, this is my Pixel. The little kitty who hates me. And I think you're familiar with ButtersOK, aka Professor Chaos. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She did say dude. But I refer to everybody and everything as dude (and have been soundly chastised for doing so). It didn't occur to me that she probably meant literal dude! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on whether boy or girl!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With those eyes, I'd name it Daemon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I slept in this morning and woke up to this (and its aftermath). Thank you! I hope 2020 is awesome for you. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I nearly showered the security lady with my raffle ticket confetti on that last goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only things missing are flying water bottles and a good 'ol bench clearing brawl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a crazy hockey game. With more scoring changes than I've ever heard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who needs cheerleaders when you have the DancingUsher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily Marriott hasn't started that. That sucks and is dumb. I could see it at skeevy hotels where people steal stuff, but not at the big names!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She used to go to Everett games with me sometimes. I would just have to tell her when it was safe to look up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a friend who gets sick to her stomach watching fights, in hockey or anywhere else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What hotels?? That's crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A three goal lead is still pretty solid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw it bounce from the back of the net to under Lyda. I was surprised that neither the ref or the goal judge did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not opposed to moving furniture to get at them. Burying them in one of the 10 extra pillows is also acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does the CHLHockey app work for anyone? It never gets past "loading configuration" for me. I want the old TheWHL or SeattleTbirds app back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always unplug the alarm clock, unless it's the kind with USB ports built in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! The SeattleTbirds clearly had a great Christmas break. Such a great game so far!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That looked not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm also super excited that my nephew is coming back to volunteer a third time. First two were before he joined the Army. Now he's active duty, but close enough to come back (as a medic now).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friends and friends I haven't met yet, this is a great opportunity to support an amazing cause. Come volunteer with me! seattle volunteer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Upon meeting you, I assumed you were an X. Properly pissed off in general, yet still approachable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for standing up for us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2019 was a crazy busy year. Not sure now TripIt thinks I went to 9 countries though. I live in one, traveled to 1 other. Though I did get to 3 US territories. Flew about 135k miles this year though. That was plenty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Driving too fast for conditions"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Princess Bride<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently not everyone got it at 0530. There was a randomness to when or if certain people in the group received certain things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mom has started texting apologies to people. Including the "we don't know you" person, who she actually does know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our Arlos think they're dogs today. Everytime a trash truck drives by, every camera with a glimpse of it fires off. Usually, they ignore them. And it's double trash day in our neighborhood, so there are trucks constantly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So from what I can gather, we're going to war with Canada over Home Alone? SpiritOfChristmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was also this lovely picture of a quilt at 0530 this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. Mom's group text resulted in this.. Those poor, poor people. Wierdly, I'm not getting all the messages. This one is from my sis's flip phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Universities sometimes have the full feed for no cost. But by and large, public safety lacks the skills to use it well. That's where the whole Dataminr debacle happened..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has gotten much harder to do because Twitter limits the number of Tweets you can pull via the API (unless you pay the $$$$$$$ for the full feed) AND people have gotten much more savvy about removing their location info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a book called When Religion Becomes Evil. It's a decent read that includes most every type of faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I very much appreciate this stance AND that DC is transparent about incidents and resolutions. Another org I'm part of has a secret squirrel mentality about it, so everybody thinks they're the only person experiencing harassment and hate. It's not healthy for the org.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I'm trying to explain to my mom that she has zero control over other people responding to the group. She included someone who has a "pay as you go" flip phone, who is now out $$$ for all this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The giant group text is the gift that keeps on giving. My great Aunt just e-mail me to tell me my Mom's phone must have a virus because she's gotten the original message 15 times ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I number I don't know sent a photo of a quilt at 0530. With BIL still in the loop . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>13 hours later and mom's giant group chat is still going. And people are demanding to be taken off of it. It's 0300 for some of them . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread is everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did my Twitter civic duty this week. TheBADASS_army<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mom just sent a Merry Christmas text to the fam. I replied with a goofy picture. Turns out it wasn't just to the fam. Enjoy that photo people I don't know ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What blocklists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Randomly surfing YouTube and come across a collaboration between LZZYHALE and AmyLeeEV from 2012. Please do more of this!! mindblown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're going in May!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. It's due Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has been a very interesting cluster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friends, I have planned poorly. It's Christmas Eve and I have no tonic water in the house. I did find some KinaTonic in the back of the fridge, so all is not lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yes, I used my old police department mug for booze now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to the store for marshmallows last night so I could do this tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had similar a few years ago. Ended with her throwing everybody out and hauling grandma back to her house 2 states away. I ended up calling my sister (crying) from a Barnes and Noble bathroom because I somehow got blamed for the whole thing. Haven't been back ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me, at 46. This is why gift bags were created.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never watched the Office, but I love Jack Ryan! Did realize those two guys were the same guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband is on-call all week at his new job. The nice part is it's 100% remote, so he just has to stagger into the other room when it goes off at 0-dark-thirty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this too meta?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got new MasterDynamic earphones for early Christmas. I'm putting them through their paces with my favorite symphony: Beethoven's 6th. 1) they are amazing. 2) I sometimes forget how much I love this symphony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have 30 hours of client work due on Friday. I regret taking this job and I don't want to to do it. Luckily I have zero other plans between now and then, except maybe a trip to the casino buffet tomorrow for dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what the app is for. Be complicated there, and it will be ready for you when you walk in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Camera goes off at 0630. That can't be good! Turns out it was just the head lamp and shorts wearing postal carrier, who nearly biffed it on our frozen door mat, delivering a package. postoffice beforedawn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I nearly shot bourbon out my nose!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe NHLSeattle_ should just skip having a mascot. No mascot will ever come close to the perfection that is GrittyNHL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depending on the document, you can do basic PDF scans with your phone now. I got a printer/scanner combo though and have slowly been scanning years worth of stuff. My goal is to no longer have a file cabinet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get Amazon Prime and watch The Expanse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I pay them as schedule, I'll have them all paid off when I'm 63. Yes, 63. I really don't want to wait that long ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In spite of the, uh, interesting year we've had at our house, I managed to pay off one of my student loans almost 7 years early. Only 5 left to go ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to like and retweet this a million times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. no compromise. Yes, it does clearly say they will remove me, but they offer to remove you sooner for a fee. That seems .... wrong. And exploitative. Some of their site made me laugh though. Clearly they've been accused of being exploitative before ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starts in February!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I just found a new TV show to nerd out over. LEGOMastersFOX!! Who would have ever thought I'd be excited about watching people build with Legos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Closest one is Kent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's helping me today. Or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New plan, not new doc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've changed plans twice in the past 3 months. From $1400/mo cobra to employer plan. Lost preferred pharmacy. And my doc is dropping at end of year, so had to pick a new one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine does, but there's no CVS here. I just moved everything to Fred Meyer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Insurance. Got home from vacation to an $800 bill because the anesthesiologist I "choose" was out of network. And today found out my new insurance doesn't cover Walgreens pharmacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area emergency management job with Pierce County as a PIO. emjobs emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spending the day after a 13 day vacation in an all-day training might have been a poor choice. Only thing that's going to get me through is that the lead instructor is my favorite Cajun. emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great vacation, but I'm very ready to be home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is someone wearing an overwhelming amount of cologne on this flight. I'm willing to bet it's the guy in front of me who had to be told to get off his phone AND to buckle up well after we started taxiing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We always had fun dressing up once a year and eating somebody else's food and drinking their booze!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downside of husband working remote and me working for myself: no holiday shindigs to get dressed up for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suspect this is an AmericanAir catering fail. Or they want to put the toilet in the plane through it's paces!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I realized I posted about the start of our Uber adventure yesterday, but never finished. I planned poorly. Our Uber driver kindly didn't leave us stranded in the Andes, we paid him well for it. And I got pics of amazing birds!! ecquador<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On our way home from our magical trip to the Galapagos. I got my limit of overly pretentious entitled people by about 5 AM. Their "worst ever" travel experiences today baffle me. Worst security line: they decided last minute we could leave everything in our bags. HORRIBLE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's magic!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking an uber to see the jocotoco_org Yanacocha Reserve in Ecquador. Transport choice validated when a taxi blew the light we were stopped at and nearly took out a pedestrian. Taxi driver got screamed at and we all laughed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! I'll do that when I get home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh, a rare vacation treat. Both cats in the cat cam at once!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First real casualty of the trip. This Victorinox suitcase wheel is not supposed to look like this . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some cool infosec and privacy jobs listed here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last full day in Galapagos. You can see more of my photos on Instagram at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a bee in a flower! galapagos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oopsie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nite nite from the Galapagos. Also, here's a sunfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We didn't get to drive, but we did get to tour the bridge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are. Non-club will start in the spring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More highlights from our galapagos trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And continuing the bestdayever theme, WE GOT OUR NHLSeattle_ SEASON SEAT ASSIGNMENTS!! I can guarantee we are the only people traveling on a ship in the Galapagos who did this! nhlseattle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because you're fierce. And fierce women challenge things and call stuff out. And the world is better for it..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woooooo! I got my final grade for my final class for my Information Security and Assurance grad certificate! Now I have education to match my certification. Also, husband saw his fav of our cats on the cat cam. BestDayEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not! I guess I know what I'll do with some of these now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, gulls aren't known for their smarts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some highlights from today. Galapagos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my proudest moments was hearing a new sergeant establish command and designate a staging area when a his officers thought they were taking fire and the entire county self-dispatched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear BadassBowden, raeBress, and the rest of the TheBADASS_army, this Booby is just for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are my favorite pics from this afternoon. galapagos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Times 1 million!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! That was stop one of about 16 in the coming week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First Galapagos excursion complete! galapagos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No trip to Ecuador would be complete without an earthquake, right? That was exciting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so, I'm in Ecuador, right? This is the pre-cruise dinner with our shipmates. Guy next to me says, I feel like I know you. I look at him and definitely know him. Turns out he's one of my NEMAA students in Nevada. smallworld emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm putting most in Insta at scba21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We saw some things today! Ecuador<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ancestral potato soup. Our guide last night told us the one thing we had to have in Quito was the potato soup. He was not wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an outstanding idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some reading and then a rummage through the bag of holding lead me to take: a Maxalt, 3 Advil, 1 Tylenol, 1 Imodium, and some chewable ginger. I feel MUCH better!! Our last big vacation started with me puking in a fancy restaurant. Not doing that again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know those silly oxygen bars they have in Vegas? Those would actually make sense in Quito. Oof, the headache!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're here for 3 days, then sea level for a week, turn here for 2 more days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just going to like and unlike this over and over, so you get the sense that I really like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I didn't consider. The elevation in my hotel room is 9400 feet. This will take some acclimating!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you ever wondered what I do with my points and miles, is stuff like this, to share with my hubby! JWMarriott quito<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made it! quito<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhh. It turns out AmericanAir has ice cream on some flights too!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See you in a week and a half United States.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last leg about to get underway. Miami to Quito. And this one comes with a pillow and big blankie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I nearly forgot one of the best things about AmericanAir Admirals Club: hand smashed guacamole!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was hands down the best thing on Twitter this week. Maybe even this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has ice cream on cross country flights. It is delicious! One of my favorite foods on a plane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a warm chocolate chip cookie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is some serious noms on a plane. Which you can only get if you pre-order. Thanks AmericanAir!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm harmless! Unless you ask some of my students. Some of them will tell you I'm the devil herself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always worry that people think that about me. My GORUCK bag with all my crap AND my TheBADASS_army patch on it look . . . Interesting. Plus side: generates a lot more conversation than I expected, with me usually saying "let me tell you about revenge porn".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fancy AmericanAir seats. With multiple USB plugs. Comfy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh. The AmericanAir club here has a mac and cheese bar. But I'm not hungry. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leg one complete. Good morning DFW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Galapagos adventure begins!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one caused me to scare the cat. He does not appreciate guffaws when he's napping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I arrived this morning. Whew!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! It is a decidedly unhappy web server.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, so AlaskaAir your website is vomiting when I try to book flights right now. First it timed out, now telling me there are not flights on a couple of days in April. I know this isn't true!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It says it's arriving today. Hopefully it's right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit FedEx. My lens from Lensrentals is delayed. I even called when I saw it and you said it would still arrive today. You lied. Now it has no expected delivery date. It MUST arrive tomorrow. Otherwise I leave on my bucket list vacation without it. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so excited right now! We're about to head into Seattle for our NHLSeattle_ ticket appointment!! We don't actually get to pick until next week, but since we'll be on vacation, they're doing our appointment tonight, then we'll call and pick during our "real" time next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The little Twitter icon that says o have a new message won't go away. I have no new messages. A bot followed me the other day and probably messaged me, but had been deleted by the time I looked. TwitterSupport how do I fix??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot. But he's also just huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not sure this made my day less shitty, but hopefully it will yours. That's ~23 pounds of buttersok standing on my throat for reasons only he understands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of times, local DV advocates can do this, as can shelters. If it's an unreported DV, best bet might be to make contact with an advocate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The digital divide in EM is more like the digital Marianas Trench.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could have a virtual focus group ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then there's hot cocoa. Which seems to have always been ok, but is hot, warm, dark, and caffeinated. My Mormon roommate in college tried to explain to me, but I'm pretty sure my face just had the dog look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another piece of this is EMs don't even understand what's out there. DHS S&T tried to engage with the EM community. The EM rep on the call basically said "we don't need no stinking technology". And that was the end of that. Obviously it was not an IAEMETC member.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Non profits are my love! I've done several, dating back more than 20 years now! I had actually looked it up before I donated this summer because "trust but verify". :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI, you do show up in the Tax Exempt organization search and your full determination letter is there, stating you're a 501(c)3,. The 509(a)2 reference is how the org is organized (some fall under 170 rather than 509. It's not unusual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My camellia started to bloom last week. It has since had the good sense to stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's that time of year when my hands are always cold. My mom got my fingerless gloves several years ago. Problem is that they have fur around the finger end AND on the tassels that cinch them up. ButtersOK always thinks they need to die AND the fur gets stuck on my trackball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm unclear about why making face biscuits is necessary tonight. But it is. caturday lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>K. I'll try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now I have to remember your new Twitter name?????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a feature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bucket list item!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their Intrigue gin is good too. But the Epic Shi't lives up to its name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW! That is next level destruction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know who needs to hear this right now (probably pptsapper), but Epic Shi't Gin from cadeedistillery is one of the most unique (in a good way) gins I've ever had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you wondered why I'm so interested in keeping my fountain thawed, here are two reasons. flicker urbanwildlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bought one thing. But I wasn't thinking about the fact that it was Black Friday. Our POTS line jack broke and I had to get a new one. It took 3 stores, but success was eventually mine. And now the phone works too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys, I leave for Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands on Thursday and I have SO MUCH TO DO between now and then. Four classes worth of stuff to grade among other things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's cold for Seattle. Brrrrrrrr! The crows were out there pecking on the ice, so I put a gallon of boiling water in it. Submersible heater coming shortly. wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to Ace since they're a real hardware store. They went right to where the jacks should be and they were out. So I had to go to Lowes. But now I have a phone jack again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is my mortgage is there too and I'm unlikely to refi due to rage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a big check. That I've gotten every month for 3 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That thought gives me heart palpitations. But yeah, it might be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Yes, that would be worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And even more frustrating? I just wrote them a letter using their customer contact form on the BECU website. I hit submit. It ate it and told me it was due to a security violation. WTF ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ironically, this was also a lie. There is no law requiring BECU to hold my money. Only allowing them to. So apparently, BECU, who I have loved for years, now just lies about everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Stupid federal banking regs. They changed them this summer. This wasn't an issue until then. Also, stupid county govt who only pays by check or credit card. Even the feds do direct deposit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or accept credit cards from this gov client and take that fee hit. There are days when having a small business seems not worth it. Today is one of them. Stupid federal government regulations. 3/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call us each month and we'll release it they say. So I do. Oh, we can't actually do that they say. Even told me my biz was run incorrectly. Bottom line, if I actually want my money when I deposit it, I have to form an LLC now. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. BECU . New banking reg says they have to hold most of my income because it comes in the form of a big check once a month. Make a biz account they say. So I do. Oh, you're the wrong kind of business they say. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching disneyplus. Apparently ButtersOK is now a fan. He watched an entire 3 minute episode of silly blue birds. Now we're on to a 6 minute episode of CGI sandpipers. He hasn't moved. And now we need a giant 4K monitor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Radio Shack is completely out of business as far as I know. I'll stop at Lowe's tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our phone jack died. I tried to buy a new one last night. None in the electrical section. They sent me to electronics. Whereupon I had to explain what a phone jack was, what it does, and what it looks like. They didn't have one. They had an "extender" wtf that is. GetOffMyLawn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT?!?!!?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which? The Prednisone? That stuff makes me crazy!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seriously, the ShoWareCenter Dancing Usher deserves a raise. He's the highlight of the game some nights!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlikely. This is going to take a few days. BUT it's way, way less pain than it was. And I'm just hanging out in my sweats and working all day anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hurty part already wore off. My eye and cheek are numb for no particularly good reason!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I blame Smith Bothers Farms for that goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily we had our shindig over the weekend. I'm not going to be doing a lot of chewing for a few days I don't think ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 shots of lidocaine later, and the tooth is fixed. Tho I'm on a strict regimen of 3 Advil and 1 Tylenol every 6 hours because the bone is "angry." She offered me prednisone, but it makes me angry and give me panic attacks. And I look like I had a stroke. Even my eyelid is numb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me either. Until today! All better now. Except even my eyelid is numb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My definition of well at this point is simply to stop the pain. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm literally counting the minutes until I leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is really annoying too. Because the social media sites work, but none of the links people post do! All is well from the data on my phone though ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think comcast/Xfinity is having an issue. I can't get to half the internet. I can get to the more useless parts, like Twitter and Facebook though. Figures. Also, it's probably DNS ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did a workshop recently where I made people Google themselves. They were horrified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seriously never knew a tooth could hurt this bad. Emergency root canal scheduled for 3 hours from now. I've never looked forward to having a giant needle shoved in my face as much I am right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are so many birds in my yard today! I've seen flickers, robins, stellar's jays, a pigeon (or maybe a dove), and a ton of little beepy birds. Cold weather brings all the birdies to the water and food.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I was on a flight a couple of months ago where they were doing CPR on somebody. My rule is on the third call for assistance, I'll ding my button. I have training that's all expired, but it's better than nothing. Luckily, they got a bunch of people on the second call.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It seems as though part of the Twitter dumpster fire strategy is to punish people for public comments and reward them for private evil (by making private comments hard to report and not acting on them). Do better TwitterSupport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Twitter, this is indeed a pattern. You need to do a much better job of suspending people who actually threaten people. Your platform is a dumpster fire of evil and misinformation. You could fix that, but instead, you toss the people who stand up for themselves and others.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nice. My 15 year old niece did ground school last summer. Plans to get her student license in January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did a talk in ethics in disaster tech. One of my points was that we have to account for the people that our solutions don't help AND the people who are made worse by our solutions AND we have to fix our solutions or create additional ones. Have to do more than think about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't know you were a pilot!! We have to meet someday in a non-virtual way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Existing network of people, vendors, and others to assist. Lack of ego (knows when they're in over their heads and willing to say so). JIT redundancies. Probably more, but those seem to be the highlights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "not great but ok" side of the coin has a multi-disciplinary response plan that they've trained an exercised on. Ability to recognize and isolate an incident. Continuity plan that keeps basic functions going. Ability to organize. Willingness to seek and accept assistance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes loss of key people mid-incident. Lack of organized response. Unwillingness to loop in everyone in the org who can help solve the problem (s). Ignoring or rejecting valid offers of internal and external assistance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to expand on this: shit widely encompasses the inability to quickly recognize an incident, lack of expertise to deal with it, lack of a list of people to call for help, no continuity plan (can't continue basic org functions like payroll), irretrievable data/work loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an excellent idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was asked about cyber AARs. Being a smartass I said "I can sum up every cyber AAR in two ways: 1) we did something dumb, we had no plan, it all went to shit. 2) we did something dumb, we had a plan, things weren't great, but we got through it". I think it's actually accurate tho.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You are human. You reacted like a human. Nobody can fault that! But seriously, what kind of super fuckhead ex-neighbor is that? I lack an adequate adjective to describe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My brother has three crows who like him. They will wait for him to go out on his deck and fly down to see him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you leave tasty treats out for the crows, they will hold a convention!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suspect I'll be far more interested in dinner by then . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a follow-up from the last one (which ended minus one appendix). It's been a long week for someone. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are, unfortunately, a large number of people who seem to be ok with warrantless searches. The "if you don't have anything to hide" crowd doesn't seem to understand that the Constitution applies regardless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Restocked my bar with a bunch of "new to me" booze. Had just started to taste them all (had water and crackers all lined up), when family member called. Now I'm at an urgent care, waiting for them to be seen. I did get to taste all 3 new gins though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This might not be the hard sell you think it is. We have social science research that says people are more likely to prepare their pets than themselves. ButtersOK wore a Fitbit for quite a while. It was one of the old cheap ones. 1 toomany dunks in the water dish tho. It died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing on emgtwitter today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone who is there for the hockey players instead of the hockey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm excited you got to do a talk in the Motherland! Also that there was ice cream. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the Everett puck bunny behind the penalty box has drawn the attention of security. Lots of security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There isn't enough time left in this game to announce all those penalties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Define "we"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm feeling like our ItStartsNow should maybe have been ItShartsNow. That's more descriptive of our recent games . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool hockey fact that I just figured out. Dawson Butt is Jamie Butt's son. Jamie played for the Tacoma Rockets during the era I had Portland tickets. Then he played for the Sabercats and stayed in the area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only injury was to my pride, but when I was a kid, someone was keeping their pony, Bill, in our farm. Everyone got to ride him. When it was my turn, the hateful beast walked under the apple tree and bucked me off, into the tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This +. So many small organizations have nobody. Even some larger ones have nobody. Sometimes they don't even know they need somebody. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ice cream on an airplane is the best!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or they've known each other since kindergarten or something. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was there a fist bump there at the end?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a strange feeling about this new follower. Like maybe they needed to be blocked . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's earned the right to drive the Zamboni at this point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess that was a yes. AtLeastWeGotAFight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The what now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could it start now please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have concluded that we can safely change our team name to the Seattle Dammits. Leaving Thunderbirds available for the NHL team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First hockey game in over a month. letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bought a $2 part on Amazon to fix my shower door. They offered me professional installation for $710. It took me 60 seconds to swap out. I think I need to sign-up as a shower latch installer. It pays better than anything I've ever done . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many dittos. Use what you use every day. Don't have special apps for emergencies. You'll forget you have them or you'll forget how they work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't have any of them either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dislike their interface<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you're feeling better soon and the get to the cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How scary for you! My uncle has epilepsy. From the time we were little kids, we knew to do these things, plus move furniture and objects away from him if it was a grand mal seizure. We all learned basic lifeguard skills too, since he was a swimmer and my granny had a pool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh. Interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying out Aqua right now. I think I like it. I really loved Maildroid, but it hasn't had an update in more than a year, so it's basically begging for a hack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it turns out I dislike it. If it were just one account it would be fine. But with 10, it's ugly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like iOS only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Starbucks store has a window fill of photos of pets who have come through their drive thru!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no choice about the platforms used by the places I work for! I just need an interface for them all that I like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ButtersOK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I'm trying out outlook now. Not a big fan. A single letter isn't enough to tell me which account I'm in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey nerds, what is your favorite Android email client that handles IMAP, Outlook, Office 365, Gmail. I've used Maildroid for years, but it hasn't been updated in more than a year and it has started sucking down data like crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we let a guy who was convicted of a crime related to his ballot measures put more of them on the ballot???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, yes. By the aging crowd of this non-profit loves it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So begins the process of trying to wrestle control of a Facebook profile that should have been setup as a page. I have two potential options, but I'm guessing this will end with me just asking FB to delete the profile. Ugh. This is what happens when you don't follow the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. So the person with the $250k car is going to pay the same for car tags that I for for my 12 year old truck. And we'll have no roads to drive on and less public transit than we do now. Good job Washington.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhh. Students gave me flowers! Which fit in my cup holder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is going to be a day. Leaving shortly for a day of meetings, presentations, dining. I'll be back in 12 hours if I'm lucky. It's almost all fun (except for one difficult conversation to be had), but it's a long day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only the best thing ever!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine was given to me, in 1988. Had nothing to do with tech, but I've used it every since. First responders think it's a firefighter reference. Divers think I just can't spell. Neither are right ... BehindTheHandle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I still have a set in my attic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is amazing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have exactly one job on this football team dude. It's too kick the football between the goal posts. Not into them. Not outside of them. Between them. One. Job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to watch the Seahawks game in a tiny tv in a hospital waiting room while a relative has an emergency appendectomy. I also learned that they make 12s scrubs. The nurses are wearing them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The phone rang and disturbed him. So now this. caturday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a bird. Many birds actually. And some squirrels. And a clean swath on my desk where ButtersOK and his giant tail have swiped everything away. And much cat chatter. LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area emergency management job, with King County Facilities Management Division, as an EM Program Manager. EMJobs EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed! I turned the lights off at 9:02, right after a group left. It's cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was maybe 8 or 9. Not much tricking to do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy birthday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It probably belongs! I have also debated putting Here's To Us by Halestorm in there . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. When I was a kid, we would trick-or-treat with my cousin in the city. I remember a lady asked us all where we were from. My cousin got a full-size candy bar. My sis and I got sticks of gum or something. Everyone felt bad, except that smug, stupid woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our AlaskaAir flight landed early, but now we're late because we're sitting and waiting for a gate to open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WiFi is allowed in airplane mode! They even sell you the service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too funny. I recognized one of the AlaskaAir flight attendants for HNL to SEA. We compared notes. She was on the flight I had to PHL last week! IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I made a new temporary friend, who is on the other side of the empty seat. We're sharing the middle tray table. And talking shop (he's a frequent traveler fed).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just got shushed by a flight attendant for talking too loud. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WiFi enabled calling is starling sometimes. I'm over ocean between Guam and Hawaii and my phone rang. No, I didn't answer it. I'm not that person!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to do more talks, more research. Maybe work as hard as I did this year, just to pay off all my student loans, so I can go back to being a more balanced human in 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying to have a working trip! I'm hoping to force myself to sleep on the second leg, a red-eye from Honolulu to Seattle. It will be day when I get home and I have stuff to do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, that was AmericanAir. Interestingly, it may have been illegal for them to have done so under Washington State law. I'm checking that angle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand the question!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends. I don't do a lot of them, so I don't have status on the airlines that do the long hauls. I challenged into United Platinum, so I get any seat I want in coach, but I'm only eligible for paid upgrades. Im in this seat, with nobody next to me though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boarded my flight for home. And in the greatest of miracles, the seat next to me is empty. That makes this long-ass flight much more pleasant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in other news, I also get paid to do work. I will even earn hundreds of thousands of dollars over two decades. I'm also on the faculty at a prestigious University. I guess I have more in common with Warren than I thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are exactly the hero our world needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He figured that out eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Co-worker lost his phone in the ocean. In a dry bag. Calls are still going through and "find my phone" still shows it active. It has no passcode on it. It has a file on it with all his usernames and passwords on it, with no password. He better hope that bag springs a leak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this hotel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my ride was waiting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll probably work on the trip back to. I can get a surprising amount of stuff done when nobody interrupts me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just another hour till we land in Guam. I've managed to stay awake and mostly productive for the past 17 hours. I'm getting kinda punchy though. And hungry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So al-Baghdadi would be akin to the Dread Pirate Roberts. Except for being real and evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Human brain: nothing bad has ever happened, so nothing bad ever will. It's the exact same problem we have in infosec. "I never thought it could happen to me" is the common refrain. I'm working on some research right now too try to figure out an answer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plenty of things have less than 2 hour notice, depending on where you live: lahar, earthquake, fast moving fire, landslide, dam failure, flash floods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My folks live two houses from my sister, on purpose, but everyone is gone during the day. In think about this A LOT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of my parents neighbors work during the day. Maybe all of them at this point. And in a fast moving event, there would be no way to get to my mom. There are only about 6 neighbor houses in a reasonable distance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they absolutely won't move to places where there are others options because they are self-reliant. Except when they're not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then there's simple things. Like my folks. They're pretty self reliant, but they don't have extra cash and my mom can't drive anymore. If she got an evac order when my dad wasn't home and the neighbors weren't either, she'd be stuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't tell you the number of times I had to explain to people that the big pretty mountain was actually a volcano that would someday try to kill them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except we have a LOT more people concentrated in smaller spaces. And we've built into places that are known hazards, and into places we didn't know were hazards until after we built. AND there's no requirement to tell people about hazards when the move into a place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've flown more than 100k already this year. And not done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not just California and it's not just fires. We have huge amounts of research accumulated that point us at the problem. We lack the collective will to do anything about it. Requires better communication methods, better planning, more resources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have lounge membership. It has those creepy multifunction toilets. But they were clean!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is important. The most good for the most people nearly always overlooks the same groups of people. And if it's predictable, it's preventable. So let's start preventing this emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HNL is not a tech friendly airport!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An infosec certificate from Kennesaw State<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy discovery at HNL. An Admirals Club disguised as a JAL lounge. With a serve yourself bar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good news is I got 90% on the test and I never have to see that book again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then there was a whole conversation where they tried to explain what hummus was. Whereupon it became obvious they didn't actually know. The best they could do was "dip". Hell, it's a whole food group!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are so clueless. We're in a very Asian airport lounge in HNL. It has no food. A couple came in. Asked multiple times if they had hummus. NO FOOD people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to read a book called The Deadline for my project management class. It was horrible. Throwback to 90s tech industry. Now I have to find an airport lounge and take a test on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Safely in HNL. For a whole 3 hours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do. Those people also had their own. They were just rude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone seems to have calmed down now. Lady is aggressively working on an electronic jigsaw puzzle. Which is as weird as it sounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some annoying guy is watching a video with his wife without headphones. I can hear it over my noise cancelling ones. Lady next to me had enough and told him off. We haven't pushed back from the gate yet. Might be a longggg flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Teen Vogue. I got my niece a subscription, and then they converted to online only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alas, I am not on that AlaskaAir plane. It does sound fun though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this begins 18 hours of travel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My second trip there this year. Well, technically third. I stayed there coming and going from CNMI. If I were to go for fun, it would be at least a 10 day trip!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to Guam in the morning. It's a longggggg trip for one day of work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might should have used the word terrified instead . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made a bunch of people sad today by making them Google themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to kick off a workshop on website and security guidance and best practices for NWRSIA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the funniest thing I've read all day. Good job Popehat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Technically anti-blue light treatment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine are prescription, so they magnify and block glare. I love them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got anti-glare glasses, which help a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I rented a camera lens from Lensrentals for the week, mostly to take to Guam. But I played around with it the last couple of days. It's a nikon 500mm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in other important news, we accidentally ran out of cat kibble this morning. We had more by this evening (thanks amazon) but ButtersOK would like it noted that he nearly starved to death in the interim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(pssst. the husband person got a job offer today, after 15 months of involuntary leave)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I just don't normally wait until this last minute!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank god you didn't! Somebody did that to me earlier this year and the "flight" part of my brain engaged. I nearly backed myself over an easel. In front of a room full of people. It was very awkward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to deliver a presentation at 4 PM tomorrow on website and security requirements for a bunch of chapters of an organization. I have not even opened PowerPoint yet ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all perception! I think the fact that you didn't just launch and hug me and asked first was what stuck with me. My brain interpreted that as calm and restrained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Met. I MET a Katelyn in the middle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually feel like I a Katelyn in the middle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area emergency management job, with Kaiser Permanente in Renton. EMJobs EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is Colorado's wall to keep out invading cows from Wyoming? Or is it to hold the GMO corn in Nebraska at bay? confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh Hertz. You never checked my car back in at PHL last night. I can reach anyone there. All I can get is a nice woman in India. Who helpfully gave me the number for the Philly train station location. So I'm starting over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who is in charge of arresting people who enter a SCIF with a cell phone? Sounds like they're about to run out of handcuffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh. Canada mountains. That's a rare treat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Our AlaskaAir flight is scheduled to land a full hour early. We should take the Canadian route more often! Downside is that there might not be a gate for us since we're so early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. Our PHL to SEA flight is taking a North route, mostly over Canada. Apparently very strong winds across the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that they are a SeattleTbirds sponsor now. They can take their little sandwiches of hate and go elsewhere. I guess the upside is that any money they're spending on hockey promos isn't going towards causes designed to destroy the rights of people I love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried out a MinuteSuites this morning since it's part of my prioritypasscom. Had an actual nap before I start this early day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it was a good run, but all my ads are back to English. Better luck next time Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching the NFL game on TV right now, which is in Dallas. Keep thinking how very bad this night could be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This video is terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She had a great conversation with your pilots! The highlight appeared to be "I got to push a button!!". Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was pretty cute when the flight attendant came back and told her it was a go. Niece got to tell her about taking private pilot ground school. FA was very encouraging about her becoming a pilot. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She just marched herself up front and asked if she could have a cockpit tour after the flight. Flight attendant called the pilot and tour is a go. She's apparently very exited to see the joystick that's used in an Airbus. Thanks AlaskaAir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My niece, the aspiring pilot, is sitting on our AlaskaAir flight home doing her college trig homework. She's a high school sophomore. I feel mildly dumb . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Hamilton was AMAZING! It was better than I could have ever imagined. Thanks for making it Lin_Manuel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, that amount of money would completely pay off one of my student loans and part of another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first trip to San Francisco (airport connections don't count). It was like nerd Mecca driving here. Tomorrow, seeing Hamilton with my sister and niece. I'm so excited!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. Checked it. Even shut it off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's installment of "so you're a Russian influencer now".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe I'm a secret Russian influencer? Or maybe it's related to the second tweet there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed yes. When they reposted the job, neither of us applied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in California as we speak, teaching a basic EM Academy. And our hope is also in local and state government and individuals, who have a far more vested interest in outcomes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree and this is what I do for a living. It's been horrible this far, which begs the question of how much worse it could be. The saving grace is there ARE competent and committed civil servants carrying out the work, which gives me some hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. A friend and I interviewed for the same job. She was labeled a wallflower and I was labeled too aggressive. They hired some dude who make poor choices and was ousted within a year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how you do it people. EMGTwitter infosec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I the common thread? Or is there an invasion underway?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's installment of Live From Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It does look like a spiffy vacuum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never been to Russia!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, but it way connected to a US server. Checked that right away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the update. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What action would you like me to take?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was very sad today when I realized it was Tuesday, not Wednesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always ask crooks like these guys to confirm their tax status. Has led to some entertaining conversations. I don't give money to scammers..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do have interesting friends. But not that kind of interesting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the explanation for this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this clears it all up. Or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a third. This one is a Saudi ad written in Russian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure there's a perfectly logical reason for all of my Twitter ads to be in Russian. I'm just not clear on what the reason is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not entirely certain how this showed up in my feed tonight, but it's amazing. I watched the whole thing. And I hate watching videos. Thank you Jayson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm surprised there even were any.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I would guess the later. And it makes the guests happy due to the former. Until they get random music or videos sent to their random consoles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I once sent a series of cat videos on YouTube to a Chromecast under similar circumstances.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mine's in my bio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My faithful Eddie Bauer fleece was starting to look a little weary after 6+ years and 17 countries. I replaced it with a DuluthTradingCo one, that was 60% off. It's so warm and snuggly! It's got thumb holes too, which was a new requirement for me. Jacket, blankie, pillow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a cool one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>American deleted my account after more than 20 years. Apparently I am dead to them. Unfortunately, I had already bought first class tickets to South America on them when I realized this. After that, they are also dead to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still think flying is magical!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's my AlaskaAir 75K flight for this year. And we rode the bus across the airfield to get to our plane. I think that's a treat! So did the little girls standing next to me. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. Don't want to give it to someone now if it will expire in three months! I'll wait till January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I gift someone MVP status after I hit 75K, how long is their status good for?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm seriously so tired tonight. I was afraid I was going to fall asleep in the airport lounge and miss my flight. I'll be home for about 34 hours. Sleep, unpack, laundry, homework, pack, sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's on a diet. I had food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And to the fuzzy derp face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going home is always good!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, seat 1D, where literally every person on the plane can bang into you if you board too early. Which I did. But AlaskaAir gave me champagne, so it's ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Per usual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear I already followed you. But I just had to do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an epic tale of mismanagement. emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief. The bots are in overdrive this week. I can't remember ever getting this many bot DMs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang. This is alarming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just read your posts from earlier. I'm so sorry! Losing a fur friend is so hard. And I agree that the giant hairy ones are the best. So hugs from me and ButtersOK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you continue to accept Visa. I'll shop elsewhere if you don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet you don't do this at all your stores. I shop at Fred_Meyer all the time and they're happy to take my money in any form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We kept all our records and continue to add more though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang! We got rid of all of our cassettes a few years ago, with one exception, from my husband's original band.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you have on cassette?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not even going to try to get everybody to agree on an app . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We mostly think the whole thing is hilarious. Once we know dad was ok!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, lovely Clark County, NV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TFW when you're at a strange grocery store in a strange town and you find out the hard way they don't accept Visa. Like, what store does that?? MySmithsGrocery, that's who. Luckily I had enough cash. This is probably the manifestation of the kroger Visa breakup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mostly feel sorry for the rando who got to see our first hand family drama. At least she stopped using that group text before she got to the part where his favorite chicken got taken by a coyote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmmmmm! I missed the special edition summer one they had. I'm going to make an effort to not miss this one. And to spell Hendricks right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what? There's new Hendrix???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sister number two only has a flip phone and it does not text. She not only missed out on the drama, but also on having her name and phone number shared with a rando. Parental persec is the hardest . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With no immediate explanation are unsettling. All in the group chat I finally apologized to the random stranger and welcomed them to the family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently my dad was in the hospital yesterday. He's fine. My mom has a wrong phone number for one of my brothers though and included some rando in the group text she made. And won't stop texting the group. And now my sister is pissed because sudden images of your dad in an ER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should not have to be said. Ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently he is a season ticket holder too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't delay on this. And help your families out too. It took months to get my mom's birth certificate. My sister discovered errors on the birth certificates of two of her family members, which had to be corrected before ID could be issued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've mitigated this risk by having a passport and passport card, plus my DL. I never travel without two forms of ID and I leave one stowed off my person and one on. Yes, cost extra. But my big fear is losing my ID somehow and getting stranded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll retract a tiny bit of this. It's possible that some federal agencies are not compliant, but I think most are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had been explicitly told by people who hired me that taking a passport was optional since CNMI is US Commonwealth. That turned out to be untrue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are also some other odd things happening. Going through TSA in CNMI, they would not accept my non-RealID driver's license. I pointed out the law didn't apply for another year. They didn't care. Had passport, passport card, and PIV, so was ok. BUT . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A CAC card is HSPD-12 compliant, which means you can fly with it. Federal employee and federal contractor IDs are all compliant at this point as well, so can be used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's exactly what I said to her!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She is. Has a smart phone and everything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd be all over that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will admit to a certain disappointment here. She got her earbuds untangled, dug out her batteries (that I had to then retrieve from the floor for her), got a tape in, then fell asleep before she got a chance to use it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. The lady on the plane next to me has a fully functioning Sony Walkman cassette player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have friends who work for the fire department and EM in Huntington Beach. worried<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can say that in my nearly 30 years of hockey watching, I've never seen it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several of the large and medium consulting companies offer this. It takes a large pool of people to have enough available the day you need them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is the craziest thing I have ever seen in hockey. Turns out if have a penalty shot awarded and the other team had pulled their goalie, you get an automatic goal. LetsGoBirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, yes you should have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One word. Iverson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!! Dancing usher is back! hockeytweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ranger. With a strong tendency to go wizard. But I always have snacks and caffeine in my bag of holding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Victoria's goalie has spent a lot of time swimming tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. Like South Park.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit. ON A DIET. he is not in a diet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor ButtersOK. He's in a diet. I'm eating food. He is starving to death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have great neighbors. They have a beautiful African Tulip tree. The tree has decided it hates us. This is the second deposit it's left this summer(ish).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a two week conversation with support. They could not assist or explain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had 2 drivers bail on me for this morning. My regular driver is available, but can't pickup on SeaTacAirport property. And WingzTeam prohibits the driver from picking up off-airport, for no reason. At least be honest with your drivers and customers Wingz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I were a WingzTeam driver, I'd be raising a ruckus. Barring drivers from getting pickups near the airport , when there's no regulatory reason to do so, seems illegal and meanspirited. SeaTacAirport can't regulate what happens off their property, so Wingz shouldn't either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This new (unwritten) policy WingzTeam has that forces all pickups near SeaTacAirport to the airport is dumb. Customer service has "no idea" why it's happening, but someone does. Prevents any driver who doesn't have the airport stamp of approval from getting anywhere near it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never understood that. Of all the lists to hate being on, a Twitter one doesn't give me heartburn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have it in a Twitter list too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have all the feels for this. All my siblings and I found ways. Very different ways. Nobody told us we couldn't though. They just never told us we could. I suppose our best collective life hack was figuring out those paths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I that your list is alphabetical!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the kind of validation I needed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I somehow missed the news that NHLSeattle_ hired CammiGranato. I'm so exited by this!! Such a dream team coming together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an AlaskaAir sunrise at BWI_Airport. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They apparently make us play poorly too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I the only person who dislikes these seahawk uniforms?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your process is working as you designed it. And that design sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm stuck. You deleted my account entirely, so I can't login. When I called and spoke to an agent, they told me there was nothing they could do. Is there some other option?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I learned about the American issue last week. The Alaska thing is new today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just want my lifetime ones back. The agent told me no. I'll fill out the form..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After I had booked round trip first class tickets to South America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have. They told me tough luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. AmericanAir deleted my account with all my lifetime miles. And now I can't earn miles on AlaskaAir for American Airlines International flights. Apparently my takeaway is supposed to be never fly American again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. This. Is. The. Funniest. Thing. Ever. I had to stop reading 2/3 through because I was laughing so hard I was crying and could no longer see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday I had to explain that you need to logout of one MS account before you can login to another one. Complete with where the logout button is. Baby steps . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all about the audience! I'm admin for a small non-profit. The security nerd in me wants to force 2FA for everyone. The realist in me realizes that until I get to quit resetting forgotten passwords every week, 2FA will just make my life hell.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm not really. But it's consistent. At home we roast our own beans and have a lovely semi-auto espresso maker. coffeesnob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently it's InternationalCoffeeDay. I'm enjoying a handcrafted starbucks blonde roast Americano at the beautiful new AlaskaAir Lounge. iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good call. That hockey tweet was one of the best things I've ever seen on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're on Facebook, there's a great group called Make a Living Teaching Online. Run by an organization called The Babb Group. If you're not on FB, check out their website. Lots of useful info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's just the bathroom . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that Navient can't just switch my auto-pay from one account to the other with no delay? Every place else I have on auto-pay switches seamlessly. Navient takes a month, during which time they revoke your auto-pay discount. Is it really to just squeeze more $$ from me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm tired just thinking about it . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>October is crazy. I leave the house at 0530 tomorrow morning. Then I'm home a total of 6.5 days through October 30. I will be glad when the other half is gainfully employed again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is crazy! That hero dude just saved somebody a ton of $$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently "good enough" was enough for a perfect score. So yay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They read it on the internet and thought it sounded cool . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I think as ldurf pointed out, it's a milliary thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That probably explains it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably. It's weird though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people use the word vice when they mean versus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my GoalZero gear so much!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw a hummingbird trying to get a drink from the fountain. So I went out to refill the hummingbird feeder. The base had thousands of dead ants in it, who apparently climbed the pole, then drowned in sweet sugary goodness. So gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm the worst professor too. I actually tell students to evaluate the time they spend on things vs the grade they desire. I'm the the "do your very best all the time" professor. Life is too complicated for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed, yes. And I'm just getting a grad certificate right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Home work is done. To the "good enough" stage. Hopefully I'll get 85% to make up for that stinker of a 2nd exam I turned in. I just need a B overall ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, these friends know each other, which makes it even cooler. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the last week I discovered that one of my friends is a plus size men's underwear model for a major brand and another was a sentinel at the Tomb of the Unknown solider. I have the coolest friends!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did McNelly come back??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have thoughts on that anthem. She was cute though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I contend that if you can't lift your own bag into the overhead bin, you should have to check it, regardless of size!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can check bags for free but I don't. I don't need to get to the airport earlier or hang around longer to deal with them. If I'm gone for a week or less, I just have my carry-on. Which fits fine in the sizer and the overhead!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TFW when you book an 8 hour flight and SeatGuru tells you there are literally no good seats on the plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can still binge watch the existing episodes. As often as you can stomach them ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was cancelled. For good reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My body needed a nap but my brain refused. Turns out it was the perfect use for my weighted blanket. I dragged it down the stairs to the sofa and was asleep in minutes. I feel much better now ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my pet peeve. Especially when it comes via e-mail, and it's a reply to something I sent, which has my name spelled right at least 3 times! I get Sara. Sometimes Susan. Once Sahra. Drives me nuts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Woooooooooo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Twitter, the bots and trolls at about to come out with a force we've probably never seen before. You have the power to stop this. Please use it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just wish I had realized this before we got our first class tickets to Ecquador. We had other choices, but I picked AmericanAir to stack on some more lifetime miles. Derp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing is that my husband is a Million Miler, so we do fly them usually at least once a year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even united doesn't delete accounts after 18 months anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Ironically, I have roundtrip first class tickets booked to South America later this year on them.I was logging in to add my FF number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a difference between being inactive and deleted forever. Deleted forever does zero to create loyalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I love it when CSAs ask if there's anything else they can help you with when they did nothing to help in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did call them. They offered to make me a new account, starting from scratch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. It seems that AmericanAir purged my account from their system. 25 years of history, dating back to TWA days, just gone, along with all the lifetime miles I had towards 1 million. No notice, just gone. This makes me both sad and irritated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it figures I'd get that call today of all days. Hmph.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*ring* Me: this is Sarah. Guy: hi, this is X from XYX [federal agency]. Y public agency has had a cyber incident and is looking for assistance. Me: sorry I can't help you today. Just had nose surgery and I've got a load of fentynal in me that makes me unhelpful. Call this guy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is an amazing thread about an unsuspecting tourist ending up in our "German themed" mountain city. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a really good read for emgtwitter. I know there's a faction of EM that doesn't want to acknowledge climate change. Mitigation though is a key component of any hazard, including climate change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! I got to use my confetti!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did not return. It probably was something I said . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, he left this intermission. We'll see if he comes back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These hockey refs are so great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He does not seem to be having a good time. Which is sad because this is a great game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh! Signs of life. He clapped for the military member of the night and has now folded his noisemaker and has it in his hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed! Good job RealmofHelm !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was. They started doing that last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the leaner does not participate in anything. No clapping. No standing for goals. No yelling. No joy. The seat deserves better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I have a leaner to my right. 1 minute into the game and in had to ask him to stop. He halfway did. Seat used to be a season ticket holder, but she didn't renew. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Indeed. Would have been easier to break it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I destroyed this ankle several years ago, slipping on ice. I had a cab take us to a Walgreens, got some tape and an ace wrap, then the cab took us to a bar, where I taped and wrapped it in the bathroom . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm opting for bourbon and a snack . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably, but then I end up with wet socks and a puddle on the floor . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not bruising. It just hurts. I'm not overly worried about it. Mostly just annoyed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, no ice pack. I have compression socks on, so that's something. And I can't take asprin/ibuprofen/naproxen until after Tuesday. So I'm just going to have to suck it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Figure out exactly what you want to study, find a program that offers it. Interview their graduates. See what other people thought of the program. It's a big investment and you need to love it and be focused!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It was highly unusual. But also wildly inconsistent. Guy behind me had his ID checked multiple times. They skipped me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Walked into a Cracker Barrel in Maryland. Found someone I know from the West coast there. We could really use a CrackerBarrel in the Seattle area. Just sayin . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I dunno. We're flying first class to the Galapagos in December on miles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been this whole week of flight! The delay Sunday, the cancellation on Tuesday. Wednesday was uneventful. Friday was the CPR. Today the WTF security. Also, this is too much flying for one week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out he elected to change it while that trigger was being pulled.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And three ER nurses who had their headsets on and didn't hear the first pages.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can look him up on a database and know the credential is not legit. And though he doubled-down, he DID change the credential in his profile. To one that doesn't exist, from an agency that doesn't issue them. But that makes it not my problem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmmm. Misfit just asked all users to update their passwords due to "system tweaks". Smells more like data breach . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think that's the case here!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes things are a misunderstanding. I met a young professional once whose business card said CEM. I made a comment she didn't understand. Discovered that she had a Certificate in EM from a college. Put in on her card as CEM because she didn't know about the real one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Looks like he has some other false credentials there too. Hopefully he'll take it down on his own. I suspect he confused the CEM with FEMA's PDS, but he doubled-down on "Catrina" instead of listening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly! Big clue there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moral of the story: if you're going to falsely claim a credential, don't go and send connection requests to a bunch of people who actually have it. Somebody will notice . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude sent me a connection request on LinkedIn. Several colleagues in common. Then I find he's fraudulently claiming to be an iaem CEM. I challenge him and he gives me some nonsense about "the Catrina Act". Continues to argue even when pointed to correct info. emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Checking to make sure you're not in my class . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That 50 with a panel would suit your purposes fine. You just would need to decide what size panel. Smaller = slower charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I almost bought a Yeti when I found it at the Habitat for Humanity thrift store! The Sherpa 50 is on sale right now for $100 and it has a built-in inverter for laptops .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I paid full price for almost none of it. Amazon Warehouse had some, and GoalZero had some refurbished stuff. I just added a 110 inverter for the Sherpa 100 to my kit because I found it on eBay for $33!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of their battery packs also. I have 2 Sherpa 100s, 2 Nomad 28 panels, and 1 Nomad 14. The 14 can charge your small stuff, but only one thing at a time. Hence the battery for storage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything I have is from GoalZero. It's based on a list that ihackstuff from ihackcharities came up with after Maria. I can't for the life of me find the list! It's on Amazon somewhere. You can charge either of those devices direct from a Goal Zero panel, but I would get<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey Gogo the wifi on AlaskaAir 728 is horrible today. I'd use your chat client to tell you, but it won't establish a connection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A country that supports and lifts up all its citizens, that invites and welcomes newcomers, and does everything in its power to make things better for everyone. 7/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From what a fully functional democratic republic should be. In so many ways, we let the terrorists win. And collectively, we don't seem to care. Never forget the country we could be. The ideal we could be working toward. 6/ 7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead, we live in a country that is deeply divided, has a growing and increasingly violent stance towards "foreigners", has an ever increasing disparity in income and access, is engaged in never-ending war, and is just generally going in the opposite direction 5/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if we had spent that money actually helping our country. Rebuilding infrastructure, providing healthcare, focusing on violence prevention, risk reduction, and hazard mitigation. We could have saved more lives than we lost (and continue to lose) due to 9/11. 4/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've spent billions to make sure you and I can't take a cup of water or a pocket knife through airport security. We've spent billions surveiling our own citizens, tracking their activities and cataloging them. Billions on never-ending war 3/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It also highlights the liberties and rights we've given up or compromised out of fear of the foreign terrorist, while at the same time accepting decidedly more deaths in this country due to gun violence, disasters, and lack of healthcare. 2/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was sorting through some stuff in my office the other day and came across this. Memories of that day are very vivid. So many people died that day and so many first responders have died since due to response related illness. 1/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have thoughts on this that I have posted on other platforms. I'm trying to decide if I want to post them to Twitter. I fear being doxxed. Still conflicted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, this was one of the best MountRainierWA fly-bys I've ever had on AlaskaAir. Felt like we could have seen climbers if they were there. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going go my old person corner to cry now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think you're super rad! Also, you made me realize I'm ok with hugging, as long as people ask first. That was a huge and personal revelation for me, thanks to a chance encounter with you in the halls of nerddom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got to see, and meet, them once. We had VIP tickets to their last show in Seattle, which didn't happen. I donated that ticket value to heartsupport because it seemed so relevant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>BTW, some books on this topic that I have my students read: Social Roots of Risk by Tierney; Risk Communication by Lundgren and McMakin; Risk Communication+Miscommunication by Boiarsky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did. It took a while. The confusing part is that it wasn't booked under a group sale. It was booked for govt rate via the app. Nobody can explain how it got put in a group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a piece of it. Another piece of it is that for YEARS the government stance was "do what we say and we'll take care of the rest". It was then, and is now, not true. However, it became THE message (think cold war, nukes, etc). We have to change that narrative, but it's hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's sad is that article is more than 20 years old and we're STILL DOING THOSE THINGS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why I intend to publish it on LinkedIn! Information should be free!!! I'm not doing it for the publishing credit. I'm doing it to advance the profession. A couple of professions even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the nephew texts me to tell me that their barracks was set on fire by a soldier trying to dry his boots in the microwave. And suddenly my day is better ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Alaska does not have Max in their fleet thankfully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My rebooked flight to Seattle is now landed and sitting because there's no gate for us. Ugh AlaskaAir and SeaTacAirport. Tomorrow has to be better, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could do so much better! I see one of the big issues being that we don't teach solid communication skills and theory to a lot of the people we put in charge of messaging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole conversation is all about what I've been thinking. I teach an EM class on risk perception, but it also applies to things outside of EM (like information security). I'm working on an article about it in fact. Got sidetracked by life though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What really sucks about this is that there were two earlier flights out of Portland that I could have made to get the connection, but not by the time I woke up and found my flight cancelled. You should use a phone dialer for middle of the night cancellations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, can you tell me the reason for the cancellation of 1499 this morning?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. For tomorrow. And phone dufus told me to have a great day. As though somehow cancelled flights and lost money before dawn equates to great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for some reason, I can't change my Marriott reservation. Neither can their agent. I have to call someone in group sales after they get to work. Somehow I'm in a group reservation block I know nothing about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has not been a good summer to fly AlaskaAir. I've had multiple delays and cancelled flights. I have loved Alaska for years because they don't have these issues. What changed? Please change it back. I need my airline to be reliable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My flight to Portland Sunday on AlaskaAir was delayed an hour and a half (for a 32 minute flight). My flight back to Seattle this morning to catch my flight to Charleston was just cancelled. So now I go a day late. This literally takes money out of my pocket that I can't recoup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing about an evening in Portland? Dinner with a cousin!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's my first trip there! Another state will be checked off the list. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Plane is fixed! Hopefully the big weather in Portland doesn't slow us down more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Still sitting. They brought a bus out so some people can bail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They issued a warning, not a watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a warning not a watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are starting to get angry. The two flights that left after us are going to arrive before us, but since we had to take a bus out here, there was no option for people to switch flights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh to flight delays. But yay that this flight will have all it's parts working. Watched the pilot do pre-flight check and he found a burned out bulb. Apparently maintenance brought green bulbs instead of red, so we're still waiting . . . AlaskaAir iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny story. 10 years ago today we got home from our Labor Day weekend trip and discovered that our house had been hit by lightning, during a storm that dropped a tornado in Enumclaw.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Chronic conditions are chronic conditions. People who have clinical depression shouldn't just try to wean off their meds. Nor should they be compared to addicts. Comparing addicts to those with chronic conditions is the apples to elephants comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would you even suggest that people should come off the meds they take for chronic conditions? There's a reason they're called chronic conditions. They never go away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a stupid and harmful column. When you take a drug for a chronic condition, you're not addicted to it. Doesn't matter what that condition is.

<|startoftext|>This kid is awesome and brave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As it should.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. Going to the South is hard for me because everybody does it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cyber is the emerging threat for EM though. We're responsible for COOP/COG and supporting humans in every disaster. Infosec is not solely an IT problem. AND it doesn't matter if the incident was accidental or intentional. EM does consequence management regardless of cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wasn't ma'am, so no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People just tell me things. Things I should not know. It's hard to be smug though when you can't tell anybody else the things you know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dry heat, just like my oven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. So many typos there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND, there's the financial issue. If my smaller jurisdiction opens up everything we have, that costs us a lot of money, which we never recoup if we're outside the disaster area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, but full is full and you have to keep driving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember a planning meeting where I started that my city in the valley way going to evacuate uphill in a flood. The uphill city said we couldn't. I asked if they understood human nature!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that right there is exactly the point! In addition to your own population, how many evacuees and their pets do you plan for AND have capacity for? If an extra 1000 pets show up in your town, can you care for them or do they have to keep driving?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plan writing and plan execution are two different things. And for something like a Florida Hurricane, you're really asking GA, AL, SC to have plans, not Florida. At least for storms aimed mid--to-north Florida.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw the Texas plan in action during Harvey. It kind of stunk. Closest human shelter to where we were was 40 miles away and didn't take pets. People trying to recover had to schlep. Many just left and never came back. It was nearly a week before I saw a dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my grad students just wrote her thesis on animal sheltering. She found that local jurisdictions were doing a much better job of this than state level ones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's in most plans that I've seen. But again, the capacity that any one government has is less than their actual need in most cases. AND they are planning for their own population, not an evacuated population from elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The entire shelter system, for people and animals, requires multi-sector effort. It's more it less spelled out in the National Mass Care Strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government can't provide sufficient people sheltering either, which is why the Red Cross is relied upon in so many places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government usually doesn't have the capacity. Most partner with non-profit animal groups for animal sheltering. Here, we have contracts with the big national animal non-profits to run co-located pet shelters. It's not a service that government can do directly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even Airbnb gets on-board with pet-friendly disaster housing! But you also have to been a bit more savvy to access it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's some of both. There's limited capacity for pets and they fill quickly. So you just have to keep going further, whereas if you didn't have pets, you might find something closer that wasn't yet full.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, what might have previously been a 4 hour drive might be 10 simply due to traffic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has changed, but it's capacity issue. In Texas, you can go multiple directions to evacuate. In Florida, you can basically go one. And much of that one direction is under evac orders also. When fam with pets left Florida for Irma, one went to TN and the other to AL. Long drive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Des Moines, IA vs Des Moines, WA. Also, Nevada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just described anti-vaxxers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell, I have a degree in Public Admin (nearly a PhD even) which is mostly PoliSci and I don't know what people are talking about half the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not on Twitter, but on IRC (we're old). There were no fancy restaurants because we were poor. We lived a very long way from each other. There were phone calls (expensive!) and email. I still have the emails. That was 1995. Our 22nd anniversary is this year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sooooo, turns out she's also very kissy. She kissed some dude. Tried to kiss some lady who did a bob and weave out of it. Then she sat in my lap. I told her to get off of me. She did not. Then she tried to kiss me. That didn't end well for her. No cops though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhhhhh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An oversight? I'd like to avoid this type of oversight, so please name names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, seriously, if this drunk lady yells byeeeeeee one more time, I might scream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, also, I passed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For some reason, the grad class I'm taking has a test due during the holiday weekend. So I took it, in a tent, via hot spot, with sweat dripping on my glasses constantly. And it's one that uses a video recording to make sure you don't cheat. Have fun watching that, proctor!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear fema, what Eric_Holdeman said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All those new graduates of FEMA_EMI's NEMAA. Welcome to our fold! emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm eating belVita chocolate crackers and drinking sangria. Don't judge me . . . Camping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just had to check and make sure my husband was still with me and that he hadn't ended up in Mobile somehow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for reasons I don't understand, Spotify will only ID me by number now, not name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wahahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is!! I had no idea anybody ever saw it! emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They asked for, and I sent, my proof of identity, along with my state issued business license showing it's a registered tradename of my company. TwitterSupport was like nah, we see nothing wrong here. And they just gave jack his account back like it's nothing. Jerks. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A couple of weeks ago, we set out to regain control of a twitter account that was lost before they enacted real multi-factor authentication. All of our original posts were deleted, it was used for spam, and has been dormant for a while now (years). 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But that account posts the same shit, so I'm not sure we'd even notice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We just had this discussion. Along with "I hope they don't give him his account back either", as they do to us regular folk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you checked out Twitter main account? Also odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uhhhhhhh. And the retweets are no bueno.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So thus it must be that having a Waffle House nearby causes disasters. They should probably stay where they are . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, you're in TC?! There's a defcon group there. dc509 I think. Some of them are active on the v Twitter. I have fam in TC, so have spent much time there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yay for this!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, still south of Seattle. For some reason I thought you ended up closer to Spokane though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know for sure there's a 2600 meetup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we don't have actual disasters in the PNW.. No Waffle Houses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a place a regularly go where I'm allergic to their laundry soap. Silk sheets save me from looking like an itchy blob . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with this, but I also carry a silk sleep sack because sometimes I have no choice in where I stay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, new travel sangria pot is in play. And it has attracted new friends, who brought gifts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This thread deserves a "final closure" update. I received a letter from the Fire Chief of the below referenced "dude". The letter refers to him as a former employee.

<|startoftext|>I've been trolling fake great-auntie the whole time, just to see what happens. They helpfully confirm that my deceased grandmother is just fine. I report them again to facebook.

<|startoftext|>I warn the fam and tag her on Facebook. She's nearly 80, as are her cousins and other family members. They don't know to poke around in the guts of the forsaken system to see that it's fake great auntie. I report to Facebook. They ignore me the first time. 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I answer, then "she" hits me with a scam. I'm like, WTF, this isn't my great auntie at all! When I pull up the full view of the Facebook convo, it shows her name and profile pic, but says it's a Messenger only account for someone who doesn't have Facebook. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a rant about facebook. A couple of days ago, I got a PM from my great auntie in Facebook. I don't use messenger, so I could see it via web. It was a simple "how are you doing" which is a totally legit thing for my great auntie to say. 1/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm finally going to see Hamilton! Better yet, in San Francisco with my sister and niece. We're making a day adventure out of it. It will be so much fun!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You should just be hoping to avoid EWR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landed. Yay! Almost home . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things are much calmer back there now. Waiting to see if medics meet us at the gate. Still an hour out . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catering fail. IAD was such an epic cluster we were probably lucky to get anything at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Book of Faces was just reminding me about our Utah roadtrip!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They never had any Woodford to begin with. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My brother passed out on one with me a couple of years ago. I was in last row of first class and they were right behind me. Something whacks me in the arm, and it's my brother as my sis-in-law is dumping him in the aisle. We laugh about it now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems as though we're going to continue on, but there is significant dither back there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we're over North Dakota somewhere. Third call to the pilot is being made . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every once in a while, I end up in a bizarre travel sequence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit. One down in the aisle mid-cabin. They seem to have found somebody to help, but flight attendant just called the pilot with info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh-oh. We're now to the "if there's a doctor or nurse or EMT on board, please ring your call light" part of the flight. And no light got dinged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe we could get alyankovic to headline DefconProm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ice cream did not melt!! Also, night mode on this phone is awesome! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. Don't get me started on rum. Zaya. Zacapa XO. Barbencourt 15. I might be pricing myself out of prom . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this point, I'm just glad we're in the air. You can read whole Tweetstorm about that though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TBH, my current go-to at home is Breckenridge Reserve blend and Basil Hayden's. But I'm totes good with Woodford!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The airplane I'm on is currently out of it and I'm mildly grumpy about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you get Woodford, I'm in. I might be in anyway, but that would seal it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This flight has now reached crisis level. THEY HAVE NO BOURBON. And the only gin is Tanqueray. I am officially over this trip. Unfortunately, it won't be over me for like 4 more hours. If the ice cream all melted, I might cry. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey emgtwitter and smem in Australia, this is an outstanding opportunity for your vost or other OSINT focused groups to do some amazing good and have some fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turbulence is expected to stay bad enough that they can't bring the carts out. I'm thankfully in first class, where snacks are happening since they don't require a cart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delivery fee would be huge!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need food, not rest! But thanks for the appreciation. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, they all got told to sit down, when the one from the front was on an errand in back. So they're all stuck on back now (pilot just told us).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Left the training site a little late, traffic was a little heavy, putting gas in the rental was a cluster, a little delay in boarding the plane, then sat on it for 2+ hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They all seem to have disappeared. The front one went to the back and I've seen none of them since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is in parts of the country. Slow rollout since PSAPs have to have correct tech in place. And location data is not transmitted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now turbulence. I'm really hungry. Very near to hangry I had lunch like 10 hours ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can somebody explain to me why our country is talking about buying other countries? We can't even afford the payments on the one we have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we can choose from township/range/section, lat/long, Thomas guide, or words. Because numbers are hard. I'm still cranky that the Thomas Guide replaced the other two!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a general beef with people who go outside things and don't learn to read or use maps. Also, get off my lawn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a different use case which makes sense to me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My main beef is that the most likely places for people to get lost in the US are also places that have no cell or data coverage. And if they do have coverage, their lat/long is transmitted with their 911 call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh God. I just had a huge flap on the Facebook with somebody about this. It's cool and all, but I don't think we need yet another thing for our 911 call takers to have to deal with. Maybe other use cases though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think things got a little crazy in ATC when we were taxiing around still too. We made a VERY hard stop. I looked out and there was a giant Lufthansa plane close and perpendicular to us that had just done the same thing. It turned it's lights off and we continued on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we're on our way! Overhead bin door popped open right after takeoff. Flight attendant had to jump up and secure it. Assuming nothing else happens, arrival delay will be 2 hours 17 minutes. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought the same until I came across those skunks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go for real!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be sure to watch for the little skunk family. They are adorable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhh. That also means an extra day of per diem! Silver lining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily I don't have an early meeting tomorrow. It will be well after midnight before I get home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I'm hungry. Really hungry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People had almost two hours in which to get off! A mom and kid did. The rest of us stuck it out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally taxiing around the airport. There are planes parked *everywhere*. It looks like everything that can be considered an empty space has a plane in it. We are now one of them, with an ETA for actual takeoff of 21:18.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The door did in fact close. But there are so many planes sitting around we can't push back. Been on the plane 2 hours now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woohoo! Door closing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been sitting on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes. I just hope the crew doesn't time out or anything . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least then I'd have a snack and a drink!! I love watching thunderstorms from the air though. So amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was super nasty!! And we're still sitting here in the backup . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think every kid on the plane just went up for a cockpit tour. At least the pilots aren't bored now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. The final passenger just got on this plane. We were supposed to leave nearly an hour ago. Heard convo from crew that she had a major TSA hassle. She's young too. Clearly a teen The delay worked out for her at least. Though the hassle did not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OUCH. New ETA is that we'll leave in 50 minutes. That's a big ATC delay. And I'm really hungry. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The storm has cleared and everybody is back out on the ramps. But there's a huge backlog of flights waiting for final prep and a spot in line. Our last ETA for departure was 5 minutes ago. Door still open, pilots roaming around looking bored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been to the Auschwitz memorial. I read the names of people who had the same last name as my family. I don't know if we were related, but I know they were murdered there. The young people on our trip thought every person their age should visit and learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes. Just when it looked like the weather was going to clear, lighting strike just off (or maybe on) the tarmac.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing about coast-to-coast evening flights on AlaskaAir? Ice cream!! Of course this weather has to clear out first . . . iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard a rumor that the internet is down on this plane too. That will make for a long, boring flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure there's a ground stop at IAD. Lots of lightning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm shocked to still see people on the ramp! I love a good lighting storm though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big crowd to ground lighting just off the airport. The kind that shuts ramps down . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is wearily eyeing the sky. But we're boarding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would not be surprised if this AlaskaAir flight gets delayed a little more. This just rolled over the airport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a stupid and dangerous policy hertz and you'll end up getting someone killed. You should stop doing this yesterday. Also, lesson learned, watch the dashboard when you start the car. It told me it was limited, but I didn't see it. 5/6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preventing a car from reaching the legal speed limit is ridiculous. I thought I was going to get run down by a semi that barreled up behind me. Yes, he should have backed off, but I should have had the option to speed up and give him space. I didn't. 5/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They programmed the car to go to faster than 65. It also beeped every time it hit 50, 55, or 65 and popped up a message that had to be cleared. Not only was this hugely distracting, but also dangerous. 4/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTAF is a vehicle top speed?? Then I hit 65 and realized this was not a limitation of the car, but a choice by Hertz. 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF is that? And this is displayed on the info screen. I thought this odd, but mostly annoying. Then I hit 55 MPH. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a little story about the Hertz nannycar, produced by Ford. Hertz programmed it for a top speed of 65 MPH. I rented it at IAD. The speed limit in parts of PA and VA is 70. I didn't note the car's limit until I got on the freeway. I hit 50 MPH and beep, beep, beep. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always fun times with a thunderstorm at the airport. At least I got upgraded so free drinks when we finally board!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's mostly from the people *not* paying me to be there. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did I not get one of those??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have upgraded my sticker game slightly. TraceLabs, TheBADASS_army, wisporg got added. They joined BiaSciLab ihackcharities, Stickerum, r00t0wns, cDc_Pulpit, defcon, EFF, ACLU. See a theme?? This generates a lot of side eye in federal facilities . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to talk for an hour about enhancing emergency management with emerging technology. Could be hilariously funny. iaemetc emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I walked into this classroom at the perfect time. Rogers diffusion of innovations was on the screen. Gov class member was passionately defending lack of change. Instructor "you just defined the laggard".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It happens every year. I always know when their awards are . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not that Scba either. Though I would happily give you an award for not checking to see who you're tagging . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have this car for a day and a half. I don't have time to try to sort out a swap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really Hertz? A speed limiter on my car? Bad enough it only has AM radio and the dash looks like it's wearing somebody's coffee, but a speed limiter too? FTR, it's set at 65. The speed limit in places around here is 70. That's just plain dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried to use my prioritypasscom at the new SleepboxLife at IAD. Priority Pass says it's good for one hour in any room. Staff says only standard rooms, which they are out of. Maybe next time . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pilot just said we're all good, just waiting for a spot in line. Busy night at SeaTacAirport iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. AlaskaAir 1080 shows departed. But we're still very much at the gate. The door is closed though . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This might be the thing that finally gets me to Reddit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first was 4. Now I'm wondering if I've met you along the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I look out my window and see this parakeet out there, along with a crow, a flicker, and a squirrel. It's a weird day for backyard wildlife! I think it's an Indian Ringneck parakeet. Though some dude on Nextdoor promptly told me it had to be a parrot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You would guess right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. Luckily it's not yours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Small business owner problems: large government organizations that still write checks. And don't pay you on time, so end up sending you a giant combined check. And your bank finds it suspicious, so holds it. Paper in the age of ETFs blows.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My hackerkaraoke "prize" finally made it home! defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A murder of crows outside my window this morning. Apparently water is high on their agenda today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know what this is. I know it wasn't actually shipped in 1991 . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear FedEx, I think you got the date wrong here. Or this is the biggest shipping delay in the history of shipping delays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to have been able to help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only because you're not dealing with this!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, I am not the Supreme Court Bar Association of India. Apparently failing to check Twitter usernames is popular among Indian attorneys. And then I get hammered with a bunch of bitching about India law. And then I have to liberally block . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quit tagging me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy crap. Pretty sure this violates the NianticLabs terms of service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It confirmed the song and artist name. It said Gloria by Laura Branigan. We assume it somehow became a Boston Bruins fan . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the funny part. It acknowledged the request, by the right artist, then played completely random stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is linked and we have a Spotify premium account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I told it to do it and it behaved correctly. I'm dying right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My husband is currently being trolled by our Google home device. He's telling it to play Gloria. It keeps confirming, but playing weird shit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did I end up in a 3 month old conversation about Tom Hanks??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully I will meet you next year! I saw you once, but was in "too tired to meet new people" mode at the time. Which also translates as "this chair is comfy, this drink is good, I'm not getting up to run down some poor soul who is probably trying to accomplish something" mode!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While. While damnit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>See you next year defcon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our flight is delayed because nerds planned poorly and the LAS TSA lines are huge. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, the weekend is over now, so everybody is going to start the email slog!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a new prized possession from TheBADASS_army! Thanks BadassBowden! Also, Travel Butters has an opinion about sharing private photos. defcon fierce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting up at 0300 to fly home from defcon really wasn't such a great idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are most sincerely welcome!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad I ran into you finally!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad I got to meet you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was happy to have found paper to write on! I'm a big fan of having pen and paper handy . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's about right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happened right after you left!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love volunteers, but one at one of the non-profits I support decided to try to update DNS servers. Everything is now broken. So much work to do now . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, the hacker tracker says your closing ceremonies are tomorrow. May want to fix!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alas no. Things just happened so quickly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least 2 did. I heard them talking and I was very confused. Now it all makes sense! Also, I really want one of those shirts . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I prefer the 7-11 out back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't get a black badge, but meeesensei, the hackerkaraoke boss, gifted me the sign. She even checked to see how much it was going to cost me to ship home. :P defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the best defcon hackerkaraoke photo ever taken. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or the TraceLabs OSINT CTF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And these are the people checking our rooms and going through our stuff to see if we're evil . . . defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. For a very brief period of time, I was number 1! Such a fun defcon event. And focused on doing good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The goons are awesome and tired. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody ever been to a hotel that had these towels? Maybe in California?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After all these years of defcon , I'm doing my first CTF, with TraceLabs. Having fun and doing good. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out the hardest thing to find at defcon is paper. FedEx saved the day. But now they're out . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything is half the price there! And there's a 7-11 next door to stock up on water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, that's me! No risk, no reward! hackerkaraoke HackerSummerCamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe the cousin of this . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woo! hackerkaraoke has a real stage again this year. Downside, it's very well lit. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You walked by the oval bar in Paris a few ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that you in a kilt Just_Abbey?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Security "theater" . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be at hackerkaraoke tonight and the TraceLabs event tomorrow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And why I think things like r00tzasylum critical and people like BiaSciLab are amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Visibility is critical BTW. Part of the reason I spoke last year and why I support wisporg and TheBADASS_army.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know you are. Photo matched face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't rewrite history to make it more representative than it actually was though. The panel was ultimately about history. dotMudge's comments about the present and the future were spot on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's the list of the OGs. Very few women originally (which is what the talk was about). I count just 4 here. The rest came later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can find some of them on Twitter if you check out posts from cdc and L0pht<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd have to ask them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several of the CdC and L0pht women were sitting in the front row. They chose (yes chose) not to speak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How we all feel about surveillance . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only in Vegas would I pay $7.83 for this. Ugh. DEFCON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this actually at 2?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did finally got to meet BiaSciLab! HackerSummerCamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally found a proper bourbon bar. HackerSummerCamp defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hanging with the cDc_Pulpit crowd is a trip down memory lane. HackerSummerCamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot to put IanColdwater on this list. But then she walked up to a group of us and said hi, so mission accidentally accomplished!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm also one of the oldest people in the room. Eek!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at a defcon ladies meetup. And since I've gotten here, it's been a guy on stage talking about Ada Lovelace. He's talking passionately about her, but I thought this was a networking event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shout-out to my new linecon friends from Germany, Israel, and Australia. That's kind of what defcon is about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the best!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure I'll see you in some hallway in some hotel over the next 4 days. So many hallways . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I too am in the swag line! More shared, but separated, misery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People I want to meet at defcon: BadassBowden, raeBress, tarah, k8em0, MsMaggieMayhem, CrunkComputing. Probably others I've forgotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so excited that the defcon badge is small and light this year! No records, no bricks, no trip to the chiropractor and soon as we get home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well there you go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was very much real! Not the real police, but the object itself exists!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He did. He's been in about 7 years now and is a senior devops guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool! My younger brother did the networking program at Renton Tech and it worked out very well for him..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have many questions, but I'm afraid to ask . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not. Where are you getting your degree from though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. He didn't . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ours was telling us about all the people the FBI has arrested this week at the hacker conference. Them he asked is we had heard about the guy who hacked Capital One . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! See you there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there were like 10 drops of rain and panic ensued!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only sort of. The ground stops keep happening because the lightning does! Took an hour to get our bags.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a Lyft now with a driver telling us about all the people the FBI have arrested at the hacker conference this week. And did we hear about the guy who hacked Capital One?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey josephporcelli, can you fix this? This is a real person, that's his real name, he used to work with my husband.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. And also learn to map connections. Mapping can help you see things that other methods of documenting might not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. Landed, but more lightning, so ramp is cleared. No baggage until lightning goes away. Now I'm really hungry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we're rolling again. FingersCrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And thatv winglet looked blue, like United, not Alaska. But it's the shared misery that counts!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So hungry!! I wasn't until I started thinking about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6E!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're not cancelled. They're delayed. Because lightning. As soon as ground stop is lifted, everybody will be on their way again. And I'll be about to get off this airplane and get some food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And stuck on the LAS tarmac. Ramp ops are shut down due to lightning. So close . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People in our family carry medical staplers. I might have whipped one out and often to staple it for him . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to start the never smooth descent into LAS. See you soon kids!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It makes my emergency management happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hubby forgot his headphones, so he's using my Parrot Zik's while I'm using my backup 1MoreUSA triple-driver earbuds. I forgot how great these things sound when I actually get the right fit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the most fun things I've done at hackersummercamp was help with these. One year at defcon, the other at BSides. It's how my hubby finally got his license too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're from Go2Socks!! So many cool socks there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I paid some of mine off early. I had plans to do more, but other half lost job a year ago, so back to paying minimum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they just own us for 10-20 years . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See you soon Vegas! HackerSummerCamp defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get at all why the interest rates on student loans are so high. They're double what you might pay for interest on a house or a car (depending on credit, etc.).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That describes my entire past year. I'm pretty sure I could sleep for a week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a lot of talk about cancelling student debt, which nobody can do at the moment. What you CAN DO, as a member of congress, is lower the rates on much of it. Congress sets the interest rates, which are currently AT 6.8%. Congress has the power to change this right now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you want more of the orange beast, he's at ButtersOK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also played it with the volume up. Tuxedo kitty on high alert. Orange kitty is maybe just high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my progressives. I suspect my eyes use them just like they would either bifocals or trifocals though. I've worn glasses for 40+ years, most of them multifocal. My eyes just know what to do at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So one of the best things about defcon is that it's the first trip I ever took with the person I'm now married to (for almost 22 years). Way back in 1996. It was much smaller then . . . defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like my calendar knew I needed to do laundry and pack for summer camp today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's wherever he wants to be, whenever he wants to be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm highly suspicious of the fact that there is nothing on my calendar today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a hazard mitigation opening with the State of Washington right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took a picture and it's been published in a real book! So cool (it's the middle one). ClimateChange communications EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My block list isn't short. Seems counter intuitive to have to take extra actions to eliminate the posts of someone you've blocked ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It didn't used to work that way. A block was a block!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get into the city much, especially now that the other half isn't working for F5!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best we have here is Bourbon and Bacon Fest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That might be worth a trip for!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All caps is the internet version of yelling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you're very yelly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm an even bigger fan of BetoORourke than I was before. Somebody who tells it like it is and is clearly one of my people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So apparently there's something at the Mandalay called the 1923 Bourbon Bar. That sounds promising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I beat the shit out of the bottom of our bathroom cabinet last night. It had to come out and last night was a very good night to bash something with a hammer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes me incredibly sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmmm. Someone I long ago blocked on Twitter is now showing up in one of my Tweetdeck columns. When I click them, it shows blocked. Anybody else in smem seen this happening?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are parts of every experience that might be unpleasant, but in the case of Defcon, the good outweighs the bad. I enjoy seeing old friends, making new ones, and learning new things. It's a group of people who understands me without explanation is pretty awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one just got weird. It's burning in an area just outside the tribe's "boom city" area, so they think there's probably a lot of unexploded fireworks ordinance in the fire path. That could get exciting ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just hanging out in my house, in my A/C! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I worked the Okanogan Fire, we did lose people. Firefighters. Do not like. Do not want a redo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're waiting for our first real WUI fire. Hoping it's many years from now, but it probably won't be ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm here for the bourbon recommendations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brush fire in Auburn is multiple alarms now. 2 brush rigs and a tender added (no working hydrants near), plus rehab. It's hot, breezy, and relatively low humidity for around here. Not good ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the few things we never owned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my colleagues unexpectedly passed away. The Emergency Management community and the Army lost a great man and friend. I'll miss you twheeler73. emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're going to collectively hold you to this! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are saying a code repository for what other people stored on it. It would be like them suing Facebook for what you post there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deep pockets also have herds of good lawyers. This one shouldn't get too far. I hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I lit into some dude last week who was babbling about a woman who was assaulted. He believed she was assaulted, but that she was confused about who did it. I practically yelled "you never forget the face of your assaulter" in a closed car. Grrrrrr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only problem is that she hates me. She loves the hubby. LOVES him. She treats me like I'm the other woman . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently Caturday prep is underway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Used the new feature that makes it pretty. It blew my mind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I followed two people today solely based on their names. I hope I don't regret that . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to give up Google voice when I switched to Google Fi. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread is everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bought glasses at Costco for the first time today. I'm blown away by how inexpensive they are. I've been a member for 22 years now and don't want to think about all the money I've wasted on expensive glasses in that time. I have to submit my own insurance claim, but worth it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This of course turned into consolidating all my reference material from Zotero into EndNote.

<|startoftext|>I might have found a winner:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems like there would be something out there already, but might have to DYI it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want something like that, but dumber. And with a long battery life. Something like the Misfit Ray, only without the tracking features. It just needs to buzz!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She can't hear it in her purse when she's holding hey purse. I want something like a smartwatch, without the smart or the watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is. But that only helps if it's in her hand or pocket, which it usually isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hive mind. My mom can't hear her cell phone ring most of the time. I want to find something she can wear that will connect via Bluetooth and buzz her. We don't need it to do anything else. My Googlefu has failed me. Does anybody know of such a device?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can't decide if it's the 12 beers on tap or the amazing runway views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First visit to the new AlaskaAir lounge at SEA. It's AMAZING!!! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never imagined other people have to say this. In my EOC it was occasionally WTF is the phone??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My life pretty much revolves around updating Drupal at this point ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. It will be at least 3 thanks to Steam. Dunno why they gotta be different . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is that I'm required to use Duo for 2 places. MS authenticator for 3, and then Steam which just does it's own thing. I'm going to try to consolidate and quit using Google authenticator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might try it. I'm super grateful that duosec makes it so easy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay for new phone!! Boo for resetting all my 2FA. This is an all evening project . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just slept like 9 hours in my own bed. It was glorious. And now 22 pounds of ButtersOK is laying on me, so all sleeping is over. Much purring though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes indeed, home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I plan to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for getting me home!! It's been a long dumpster-fire of a day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After never seeing another Briggs and Riley green carry-on roller bag in the wild, there were three of us standing next to each other on the SFO train.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! I remembered I had those sitting there and Bam, I'm going home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alaska flight got to SFO early enough for me to jump on a United flight using miles. I'll get home tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woo! Cashed in 10k united miles to go home tonight!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Georgetown! But I can post the reading list once I'm off airplanes and have had a nap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't typically provide infosec pros with any sort of risk communication training though, relying on "I told you to" as the primary motivator. Which isn't effective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a class that's part of a disaster management program. The concepts are exactly the same in infosec though. "I never thought it could happen to me" is the common refrain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"internalizing'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People accept risk all around them every day for precisely this reason. They are aware of the potential of bad things, but their brain tells them the the risk is to other people. I teach a whole graduate class on risk perception. Internalized the risk leads to better choices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I found a way home today. It's about a 3 hour drive, but then I have to get home from the airport. Plus I will have been up for far too long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, this AlaskaAir flight has the new first class seats with foot rests. And there's ice cream on the menu for dessert..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you calendar for reminding me that I'm missing my husband's birthday party . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though if you saw my karaoke creeper tweets from earlier this week, you'd know I'm very anti-creep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our AlaskaAir flight to SFO is running just early enough that I should be able to make the last flight direct to Seattle tonight. Cross your fingers for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Valid question!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I was the married woman in the story, so sort of!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of the issue is that I had email confirming my seat and upgrade on Flight 3. When they cancelled Flight 1, I was in no hurry since I knew I had a seat. Which was then cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SFO. To PDX. To sleep on the floor. To SEA in the morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I'm finally on a plane. Going to a city I don't want to go to. At least I'm first class and they have Woodford.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I played such a fun one! I can't remember the name right now because I've been stuck in an airport all day and my brain is fried. But it was made by TakoubaSecurity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. Now the cops have found an unattended bag. Cop is yelling to find owner. Announcement overhead. Nobody is claiming. If we get evacuated . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But thank you for looking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't get there at this point. I'm about to board for SFO, then PDX. Had that told me that two hours ago, I could have made it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. I'm not getting home until tomorrow now. A full two weeks after I left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to send the entire timeline to customer care after I get home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed! And I still wonder what happened to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Find a well used white undershirt, write DEFCON on it with a sharpie, then wear it to hacker karaoke. Hang out with people, but proposition the one married woman at the table when her husband gets up to sing. Then get pissed and leave on a huff when the table mocks you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing that deserves an explanation on all this is how I went from having a confirmed and upgraded seat on Flight 3 to having no seat at all. I don't expect you to figure it out, but somebody should..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. Ain't shit to be done for it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't be home until tomorrow now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I use the AlaskaAir hotel voucher, I get max 3 hours of sleep in PDX. If I use the sleep sack and pillow that are in my bag, I get 5 hours on the floor of PDX and don't have to deal with TSA a third time. Option 2 it is. preparedness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out the later AlaskaAir flight wasn't cancelled. My seat was. So now I'm going from DCA to SFO to PDX where I will spend the night and fly home to SEA tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. The later alaskair flight is now cancelled too. Right now I'm slated to spend the night in PDX via SFO and get home tomorrow. I also have no idea where my bag is. On the line with a CSA who is trying to sort it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been "a" week. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a confirmed first class seat on the 6:55 PM flight, so I'm going home tonight for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been week. And the thing that left me crying in the airport is that my flight is cancelled and I'll miss my husband's birthday party. I'll get home tonight, but not til almost 11.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bah. Another 3 hour delay. AlaskaAir could have flown a new plane in by now. If it does end up getting cancelled, I do have a first class seat on the late flight. Would rather have spent the day in a museum than in the airport though, if going home isn't an option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized I can see the AlaskaAir gate from the United Club. We're supposed to start our delayed boarding in 7 minutes, but there's no plane there. I'm staying put til I see a plane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. Honestly, I would rather fly in a plane where all the parts are working, so I'm ok with that part. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A guaranteed seat on the later flight just popped up on my app, so that's good. It's a horrible seat, but it's a seat! So I'm for sure getting home today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes she is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I talked to them. That's how I know the worst case scenario. The seats for the evening flight are all being held now in case this one gets cancelled. Since I have status, I would almost certainly get one of those seats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Double meh. Update is that we'll get another update from AlaskaAir in 2 hours. I'm definitely missing the kick-off of my husband's birthday party. Worst case, I end up on the evening flight. I would get home late time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ewwww<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really hoping I don't miss my husband's birthday party . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. The new boarding time on AlaskaAir flight 1 has arrived, but still no plane. Apparently the part is here though and the mechanics are working on it, but no new ETA yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I guess he'll be skipping Defcon this year . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people use their speaker phones in public places?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simply brilliant!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Air conditioning FTW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting aside. A number of men in the process said some variation of "you seem like you can handle yourself". I'm not entirely certain what that's supposed to mean, so I'm taking it as "thank you for not breaking anyone's face or hands".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've also changed the hours of the pub, so there's a much narrower window in which alcohol is available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My last post on this got eaten. The NFA superintendent (a woman!) came to meet with me, to let me know that both people had been removed by noon the next day and are not allowed back. The incident report will also go to the chief of the student.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm also happy that every class starts with a briefing on harassment and how to report it. There are also large signs posted with the same info. My suggestion was that they put something in every dorm room on how to report.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people just behave badly no matter where they are. I'm quite satisfied with the fact that at this facility, there were swift and visible consequences. They've made some very positive changes in the past year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too! And I'll still get home in time for my husband's birthday party, so it's ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. 3 hour mechanical delay on AlaskaAir. Upside though: it popped up before I went to bed, so I got an extra hour and a half to sleep in the comfy RitzCarlton bed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love karaoke too! And I'll still do it at EMI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was pretty sure I remembered the bar tender here. Turns out he's worked here for 23 years. So yeah, I remembered him. 23 years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to see Hobbs and Shaw when it comes out. Don't judge me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I guess he's skipping defcon this year then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know you're having a bad day, but this left me laughing until I cried. Thank you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not usually, thankfully. I've been coming here since 2005 and that's the only bad thing that's happened to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just met the NFA Superintendent, who to my surprise is a woman. The investigation is complete and the two people were removed from campus and aren't welcome back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yep! I was actually thinking about how much different than venue would have played out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny thing. There's a code of conduct. I actually followed it! I also managed to fish out my phone and take photos of them without missing a word of the song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One was an NFA instructor, the other was one of his students.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100% agree. I feel like I've spent also year reporting people behaving badly. It's tiring. It would be so much easier to let it go, but that's probably how we got here in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, for an instructor to do this to another instructor in front of our classes can only be intended to humiliate me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm certain the instructor is retired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm certain the EMI side will be. We'll see about NFA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I already reported. And it's the NFA side behaving badly, not our people!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So karaoke at EMI got weird. This dude and his instructor from the fire side decided to tuck dollar bills under my bra straps while I was singing. Apparently from the EFO year 4 class. Way to represent dudes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I finally gave up. Somebody had clearly been there and started setting up for the day. I left them a note on their computer keyboard to call me. No call yet . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My niece is going to a 3 week summer camp here. I am jealous!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was like something right out of a cartoon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made it back! Grabbing a snack in the AlaskaAir Lounge while I wait for my niece's plane to land. The toaster popped up with such force the my English muffin popped out and landed on the top of the toaster!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. Call just went out for a medical professional on-board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I sound like fucking Typhoid Mary. I'm sure every person who has sat near me on a plane in the past 48 hours is thrilled. Guarantee it's a virus though, since I'm currently flushing $60 worth of antibiotics and steroids through my nose every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning SFO. Almost home . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has been an incredibly smooth trip for me! A couple of minor hitches (the car in Rota), but considering the distance and locale, it couldn't have been much better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eh. We've already had two gate changes. I'm done tromping around the airport! I have my battery pack, I just like to hm save it for emergencies. Which I guess this became!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I really want after an 8 hour flight is a power outlet. HNL seems to be devoid of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too! TSA at Guam didn't recognize the RealID extension for Washington, then we had to clear US CBP to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This trip required ridiculous number of customs & entry forms, considering we never left the US. Hawaii = 1, Guam = 2, CNMI = 1, and now USA =1 (upon return to Hawaii). It also required multiple presentations of my passport, which they told me I didn't need to bring (but I did).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mainers doing Mainer shit is the best thing about that whole story (IRL and in the movie).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is supposed to be an unmonitored account!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to fly united for this trip. All is well. Except the food is hideous. Ugh. BUT, they did give us Stroopwafels! AlaskaAir has the best food, but it too could benefit from Stroopwafels. Please make a note AlaskaAir friends. stroopwafel IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would have paid to watch that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least he knew he did wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Technology is so awesome! I'm in the airport lounge in Guam. I hear a smartphone say "is there a machine to warm the bread"? A man wanted to make toast, but did recognize the contraption on the counter as a toaster. So he used his app to ask the attendant. And now I smell toast!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final island sunset. Homeward bound in the morning. guam sunset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a first! The complimentary airport shuttle from GUM to the sheratonhotels was a spiffy Lexus SUV. The best part: chilled face cloth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an unintended consequence of the Hatch Act. It forbids companies with federal contracts from trying to influence federal elections. That's a fine thing. If you happen to be an unincorporated sole-proprieter though, the restriction applies to you as an individual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Rota adventure continues. That's wildfire smoke. It's maybe 1/2 mile from here. Much wind. Ashes were falling on me outside. Some of our students had to leave to fight it. ndptc emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm on an island of 2000 people! I did find a lid, but the threads aren't right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg united. How does this even happen? I don't want to spend 20 cents a minute to be on hold to find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The AC DOES work, but only in the back of the van. So we aimed all the vents forward and are rotating between driving and riding in the back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, we have now hit the adventure part of this trip. Budget couldn't honor my car reservation because they had zero cars. The Islander car rental had one mini-van with no A/C. So that's what we have..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do I get replacement caps for the mini squeeze bag? Apparently housekeeping mistook it for trash and now it's gone. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our country has a National Mass Care Strategy. It spells out in detail how this is all supposed to work, who is supposed to do what, and EXACTLY how people, especially children, are supposed to be treated. The feds act like they've never seen it.

<|startoftext|>So today is new ISP day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No such luck out here. Best I could do was aloe. And to meet the $10 credit card minimum, I had to also get a tiny bottle of gin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I took a boat to this tiny island today. Many, many pictures on the big camera. The water was so clear I could take the pix of fish with my phone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My mom took out student loans in her early 60s. She suddenly decided she needed to get a degree in creative writing from a very expensive online school in order to get a job. She failed the courses. She didn't qualify for any other kind of loan. It was predatory and wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another great book on this topic is Risk Communication and Miscommunication: Case Studies in Science, Technology, Engineering, Government, and Community Organizations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great book on this topic is Risk Communication: A Handbook for Communicating Environmental, Safety, and Health Risks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I teach a whole class on this at GeorgetownEDM. It's about disaster communication, but the issues are exactly the same! People will only take action when they perceive a meaningful risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I put in a talk for BSidesVI about the roll of risk perception in infosec. There's a lot of social science that could help fix these things, but it gets overlooked by practitioners, who don't understand basic human behavior and thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I just looked at the guide you sent. It's completely useless for provisioning issues. The trouble I was experiencing was with the SIM not being provisioned for the carrier it found. That has to be fixed on your end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's mostly working here in CNMI. The issue was recurrent in Guam, but I'm not there anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did you bribe the goats to stand still that long??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, but he didn't bring it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This place is beautiful! And hot . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it my imagination or is that an old AlaskaAir plane sitting here in Saipan? Half an Eskimo man right there. Guessing the other half just melted off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's very yummy! Just don't drink too much at one time. You can Google that too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My colleague doesn't have pre-check. I'm not sure whether I should pity him or mock him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, it's made from the coffee cherry. That's what you call the fruit that surrounds the coffee bean when it grows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually have coffee cherry tea and it is amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the second airport I've been in where you go from security right into the duty free shop. I may take advantage of that on the way home . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It claims to be coffee, but I remain unconvinced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hotel left me a lovely note and a bottle of wine. Which I didn't open. And now I'm leaving. I hate being in nice hotels just long enough to sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. googlefi keeps switching from working to bitching about not being provisioned. Could make this a very long trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently it just took it an hour to orient itself . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmmm. My googlefi is not working in Guam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made it! Hello Guam!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Graded all my student papers that had been turned in. Then I read an entire Jack Ryan book. My eyes hurt. My whole me hurts in fact. Only about 90 minutes to go though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're off to Guam in just a few minutes . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Gonna be 7 hours of touching someone. Seat next to me was empty until after the door closed. One of the stragglers is in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks accurate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Food? Water?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! Mine got $5 last quarter. We clearly need more friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops. My colleague failed to book the leg of this adventure from Guam to Saipan. He's frantically calling United now to try and fix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My meal is being periodically interrupted by VERY LOUD construction. And this restaurant doesn't have booze yet..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I managed to find the restaurant that has no liquor license. Apparently this is a new part of the terminal and they don't have their license yet. I'm really here for the outlets and food though. The construction noise is a bonus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leg two complete. Hi HNL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Federal contract. Can't leave the country to get there, even though cheaper and faster. One option: United.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even done with leg 2 of this trip and I've dropped $19 on meh airplane food. But it was that or hangry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a large plane board is a reminder that most people suck at geometry. And that they don't understand what the bag sizers are for. That's not gonna close . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Amazon. They are Go2Socks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you're wondering, I fly SEA to SFO to HNL to GUM to SAI. There's an overnight in GUM though. That's roughly 18 hours of flight time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guys next to me in the waiting area are talking about a light saber building workshop. All I can think is that my people are going to be on this plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 0350. I'm off on a 10 day work trip to the Mariana Islands to teach debris management. It's a very long haul to get there! I bought new compression socks for the occasion. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm have to say I'm so proud of my Bachelor's students. I've had them for a class every term for their senior year. I've pushed them!

<|startoftext|>FTR, the gate agents were both WTF too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmmmm hmmmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Lord the typos there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They tell me pilot's request was "let me know if that guy is on my flight". Gate agent was just on the plane and I heard pilot "...asking me if I have a problem?". Agent left, then pilot left. This does not leave me with warm fuzzies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm able to get on AlaskaAir 1797. There's a man in the waiting area praying. Pilot walks by and makes a rude sound. Goes to gate agent, stares at man, has animated conversation. Gets on plane. Gate agents have convo. It felt wrong. I go ask WTF. 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I was in my final interview with the Chief of a police department. All of a sudden he asks if I have kids or plan to have kids "because it's been a problem for other people". I still got the job and took it ($$). But I always regarded him with a certain disgust.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also not a hugger. Watching my physical reaction, and hearing my adult description of what happened, helped him understand the much loved young lady in his life. So yay for that! Ultimately, this ends up being a conversation about consent, couched in terms of a hug. 8/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I don't have to justify those choices, but I often feel like I'm obligated to, like somehow I'm the weirdo for not hugging. And I'm glad I did. Someone came up to me afterward and noted that they have a granddaughter or a niece [my bad for not remembering which] who is 7/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was truly hilarious. It was also, thankfully, a safe space. I think he initially thought I was reacting to him, but I was actually reacting to a dreaded hug. So I made him feel bad, which made me feel bad, but then I also felt like I had to explain why I'm not a hugger. 6/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He first seemed to think maybe I was joking. And was legit confused when I was not. I could hear my co-instructors "she's not a hugger", trying to now get us all out of this highly awkward situation. He's looking at me, I'm looking at him, and still apparently backing up. 5/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought it was a joke. I've never seen him hug anybody. In an instant I knew it was not a joke. I was wholly unprepared for this and my entire being reacted accordingly. I slowly (or maybe not) backed away. Somebody said later they thought I was going to mow down an easel. 4/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I was with a group of people I've spent about 3 weeks with over the past 8 months. I'm teaching. There was a role play. I was the boss and my employees were trying to convince me to do something. Their appointed spokesperson said he was going to hug me. 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is usually not an issue. I keep an eye out for serial huggers. When I see them headed for me, I stick my arm out to shake hands. They can shake my hand, impale themselves on it, or try to do a really awkward hug. Most opt for the shake. Nobody yet has opted for impale. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not a hugger. My friends and the people I spend a lot of time around know this. I'm not anti-hugging. I DO hug people, just not a lot of them. I'm related to most of them, or have known them for a long time, or we've connected over something emotional (like a disaster). 1/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just did an interview with KeithKOMO4 at komonews about ransomware and cybersecurity. Not sure if it will get used, but it was an unexpected twist to my day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Exactly. If power is killed on the hottest days, people have no AC. In rural areas, they no place to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. This is going to kill people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oregon's company is staying they're going to do it on all red flag days in Eastern Oregon. Crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Per everyone I've talked to, the power company decides. Their attitude is "we've been telling you for 6 months that we're going to do this, you should be prepared".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems like in California, really just since last year. Oregon is about to do it for the first time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh a job opportunity. Do you think I should go for it fam??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is great for what it is, but doesn't help with AC or medical equipment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is so much wrapped up in this. Just talked to somebody who thinks the power companies are trying to use it to change the law to give them immunity for fires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's spread to Oregon now too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is particularly relevant in rural areas, where there's no place to go for cooling and people don't have the means to buy their own generator (such as my parents). We're taking vulnerable people and saying "figure it out". EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have strong feelings about power companies killing power during high fire danger days. They are not good feelings. I get that they don't want the liability of starting fires, but how are people supposed to deal with no AC and no way to keep their food cold? Discuss. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny thing. I safely eject other people's USB sticks. Mine, I just yank out and move on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I texted my husband "Hull is drunk".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Meh. A subset of people suck horribly. I'm even more glad I found out about you guys and am able to support your efforts. Being a woman in tech has never been easy. It's gotten better, a lot better, but there's still do much further to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A glorious day for flying! Hello mtrainier! Thanks AlaskaAir for the flyby. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird. Our AlaskaAir flight is out of SeaTacAirport A gates today, all the way at the end. Flight attendant she commented that in all the years she's worked here, she's never been to this end of the airport!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is magnificent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhh! My Arlo just captured a mama raccoon with two babies scooting across my driveway. Soooooo cute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something confuses me AlaskaAir. Red eye the other night (SAN/BWI), no blankets. Morning flight today (BWI/SEA), blankets. Why not on overnight flight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, 45 minute delay. But we must not be facing a strong jet stream. Only 8 minute delay into Seattle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think my flight is about to be delayed. Supposed to board in 4 minutes, but no gate yet and it doesn't appear the inbound is here yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And taking this a step further, a pentester also knows they can't reveal anything they see or find except within very limited parameters. Usually just to the people who asked them to test in the first place. Further distribution gets you fired and blacklisted. Same with people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just found out there's a BSidesVI. Now I want to go! That's a quick and lovely ferry ride.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to report to an Asst. Chief. He never made traffic stops. Ever. He was late to our staff meeting one morning because someone blew the stop sign in front of the station and he nearly hit her. He felt obligated at that point . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because some people can't comprehend the idea of consent. Which is weird for a pentester. They know they have to have consent to do legit pentesting. They know there are consequences for doing things to systems without consent. Same applies to people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you're right. If you can't respect that other people make their own choices about their own lives, Defcon probably isn't for you. 22k people make a lot of interesting choices. Most of which are of no concern to anybody but them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You get to respect your body as you wish. Your don't get to dictate how other people respect their's. It's that simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the dither over NHLSeattle_ colors and names. They could pick a potato sack with sharpie writing on it as their jersey, call themselves the spuds, and I would still buy one and wear it to every. single. game. NHLSeattle<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, if it was a scam, it was a conversation worth the $20. But on the downside, I missed out on most of the conversation the other dude is having with his pharmacy. We're to the "how do I apply it to my head" part of the convo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I either just got scammed out of $20 by a guy who said he's a Marine or I bailed an actual Marine out of a jam. I'll know by the end of the day ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude sitting here in the hotel lobby is on the phone with his pharmacy. I know his name, his date of birth, who his insurance carrier is, and that he has a scalp condition which requires a special compounding pharmacy. He's on hold now, so I'm sure I'll know more shortly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I feel this thread. I have a trip next week where I'm teaching all week.

<|startoftext|>FTR, intermission is just enough time to grill brats, pour more beer, and sit down in front of the TV with dinner. The brats had jalapeno-stout mustard and homemade sauerkraut to go with them. And some grilled potatoes and brussel sprouts. Mmmmmm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was me last night. And it was almost behind the sofa. And after unplugging one lamp, I had to move the second to the other plug so my charger would fit. Night before though, I had a sofa with built-in outlet AND USB port.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cool! My state has no certification. Hell, we barely have a state association. I haven't been able to pay my dues in a year because their website is broken and they won't tell anybody how to pay!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No worries! A couple of weeks ago, somebody who tried to get their CEM 15 years ago (and has since retired) cornered me at a conference to bitch about the degree requirement! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't disagree! Though I can't speak to the state piece, just trying to meet people and make a network was hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. And that's what trips up a lot of people. They want response years to count the same as EM years. Different job . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But they do want the TEM that has the same reqs as the AEM and that the same person with 5 years experience also can get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember talking about it somewhere publicly right after they changed it. Some guy was pissed because he didn't have a degree. I asked "why didn't you apply last year then" and he really has no answer. He just wanted to bitch about it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. It's just an old argument. 15 years old in fact!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should have applied with 20 years of experience, before there was a degree requirement!! Also, we have the AEM for them. Many states have their own certs, though it's not a substitute. It's a different cert.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I sat in my yard last night, drinking a beer and trying out this lens. Nothing spectacular, but a very busy evening. Even AlaskaAir did a flyover.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Leadership academies, regardless of who offers them are about two things: making yourself better and growing your network. They're about you, not your employer or your future employer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I have seen a job description that lists NEMAA graduate as one of their preferences!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EMI doesn't offer certifications. I think that's where the confusion comes in. It's a professional development academy, in the same way that something like the Puget Sound leadership academy is, or even Boeing's internal leadership dev program. Makes you better at what you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dm'd you my phone number. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're comparing 2 years and $45k for a grad degree to 4 weeks and $3500 for NEMAA, that's not a fair comparison!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are two requirements for AEM recert: be breathing and complete your training hours! if you're having trouble getting training hours, let's talk! Though the Academy is one way to get them. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are no government certifications in EM that I'm aware of. All certifications are offered by private or non-profit entities. And yes, toning down govt experience once in the private sector is a big deal! I do it all the time for my private sector clients.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to be clear, if I call you in the middle of a disaster because I need a resource you offer, you're part of the team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course you do! You represent the private sector, which is grossly under-represented in the academies!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now I'm envisioning an ETC after-hours meetup. Last time we were there, Marriott gave me a party room for free for a couple of hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love those things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes on the cupcakes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Update: I am in the newly designed seats again today and this one is perfectly comfy. 6F instead of 6A, which shouldn't make a difference. Maybe the other one was just bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had a nice chat afterwards too, and I finally put in my Infragard application.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I know anybody who has printed up some haveibeenpwned stickers? I'd be happy to pay for a few, but I don't want 1000. Or even 50.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was all good. I stood on the concourse and nommed it down. Very tasty!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it was a training fire. They did a second one. N<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fire training.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was definitely training. Eventually two apparatus rolled up and it quickly went out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a live stream, but maybe poor bandwidth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People, this is an ice cream sandwich. Made with a waffle that's baked as you wait. Also, it turns out the Alaska Lounge had a no outside food policy. And a no eating ice cream in the stairs to the lounge policy. complicated icecream<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So there was fancy satellite WiFi on this AlaskaAir plane, but we weren't authorized to use it. What does that even mean??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want elected officials who have better memories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ridiculous! This whole series has been. But this is exactly what you want in a game 7!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized there's still a hockey game on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're likely to find snow in places. The main highway is usually open until early October..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good because it's probably snowing then! There's a lovely lodge. And maybe VRBO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soooooo, I stayed with my aunt. Are you determined to camp?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're going to have a great day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It came back on right after I fell asleep. Was awakened by a really loud 2-way radio in the hall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woo! Power came back. For like 12 seconds. Boo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I just realized I'm going to make a tiny, but important change to my everyday carry bag when I get home. In my power go bag, I have tiny LED lights that plug into USB. Like my power brick. 2 are going in my everyday bag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been there, done that! Worse was a fire alarm (diff hotel) that started to sound, then shut off. Then the PA came on and shut off. Called front desk, no answer. Decided to self-evac. Into a gas leak. That generated a strongly worded letter from me to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh. This is interesting. The next hotel over doesn't seem to have emergency lighting anymore. I could see a glow from the hallway window on each floor, but no more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometime during the night the power in this hotel is going to (hopefully) come back on. At which point I will remember which lights were on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just went out and confirmed. No elevators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there's the chance I could have to climb 15 flights of stairs in flip flops, while dripping water everywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been empty all day!! But it also might not have lights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To converse with the poster? They can see you if mutual follow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The chocolate I just ate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That makes a little sense. One of my three replies is from someone who has a locked account. Maybe lots of people decided to lock their accounts last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now private security cruising the parking lot. And about a mile off, a huge gaggle of emergency vehicles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Started in the past few days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can decide if I'm seeing lightning or splody transformers now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was kind of cute when I called the front desk to confirm it wasn't just my room. She said they were trying to get the power back on for us. My observation post gives me a great view of what is clearly a multi-block outage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now lots of flashing lights at the next hotel over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why my everyday carry bag has so much shit in it. Fully charged battery pack. Flashlight. Snacks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you talking about the countries where they are sold to their husbands at 14, stoned to death, not allowed to drive and generally treated like property? Your should clearly think about this a lot more. Or quit thinking about it at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh fun. I'm on the 15th floor of a hotel and the power just went out. There is zero emergency lighting in my room. Mostly I'm irritated because I was just getting ready to go down for a swim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw someone else bitching about this yesterday. I don't know why I'm seeing SO MANY of these. Did I get on a block list that a bunch of people subscribe to? I know I haven't blocked that many people. Please explain Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep metal straws in my house and one in my backpack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had I dropped out sooner, I would not have regrets. The education was fine, though expensive, and it got me some great opportunities. My ABD years cost me a LOT though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My student loan payments are more than my health insurance premiums. That says a lot. I've paid some of them off already, but ugh. I have regrets about my choice to attend a for-profit University for the PhD I never finished.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. And yes. The point is your stuff should work without having to do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It kept telling my my 2FA code was wrong, but that way incorrect. I called your help desk and their only useful suggestion was to disable 2FA, login with the Kindle App, then reenable 2FA. You need to do better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh amazon. I should not have to disable 2FA to access the Kindle app on my Surface. Yet here we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could be great for disaster work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mom accidentally locked herself in the bathroom with this cat. Cat was playing in tub, heard person (she's not fond of people other than my husband) and hid behind the curtain. Startled my mom when cat made her presence known!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I somehow missed that you were in school! I have a final exam next week and then done till end of May. Except for teaching. I swear that never ends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As teen, my brother house sat for us. Played video games. Freaked self out. Then was attacked by hellhounds (aka the big cat) during the night. And by atracked, I mean snuggled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a very tiny person on the plane behind me. Was crying. Now has adorable baby giggles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We'll see if 17 year old her (with her pilot license) decides to try for a military academy or ROTC to become a pilot of bigger planes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two years ago I talked to my 13 yr old niece about the future. She likes travel (we were in Hawaii together). She was horrified at the idea of being a pilot. Too scary! For her 14th birthday, got her intro flight lesson. This summer (15yrs old) she's going to ground School camp!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bought my nephew a small case of MRE "raspberry drink" because apparently it has high trade value. And he also likes it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great article about her growing up in GOT in latest issue of Rolling Stone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a note from the Mayor today to see if there are any balls that got dropped in their end. My hunch is that the organizers underestimated their crowd, thus bypassing any extra scrutiny. Huge events happen there all the time with these issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I blame Hallmark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a cat that likes to play in bathtub water. But it has to be "just right" bathtub water and my husband has to put it there. She stands in the hallway and YELLS when it is unsatisfactory. And then we listen to splashing in the night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some lovely views from the air today. Thanks AlaskaAir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't make that connection! Thanks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got some rad new go2socks travel socks! I don't fly without compression socks . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What DID they have on the menu??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw somebody post that Q13FOX did a community interest piece on this. Also that one of the bounce houses collapsed on the kids who were in it. I'm sure that second post will be deleted shortly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of their other pastors is a "transformation engineer", which leaves me with even more questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just posted on Nextdoor. My life is probably about to become a living hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a lovely tree. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's literally somebody on the sidewalk in front of my house doing a photos hoot, using my flowering apple tree as a backdrop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And their pastor is a "worship artist". What does that even mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The event page for this contained literally hundreds of complaints about safety, parking, etc. The organizers have deleted every single post that's negative. And their personal reply to me was horribly tone deaf. They don't seem to get the safety issues THEY caused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only did humangear_inc send me replacement caps, they included a new spork! That really fantastic customer service!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This! Also, growing up in a rural community, church was the only place a budding musician could perform solo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hubby's band is playing an actual gig today! This is setup time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one ran out of 20,000 eggs ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess this was sponsored by a church. I always find it odd when churches have Easter egg hunts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found their FB event page. And this gem was just posted:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm picturing a riot in my neighborhood in 14 minutes, when the parents of all these tiny people realize they're not going to make it in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The event has been open for 54 minutes now and the line continues down that side street until it can't be seen. The line is both moving and getting longer. And apparently a helicopter is going to drop the eggs and loot in 15 minutes. No way will all these people be in by then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently there's an Easter themed event (the pagan kind) happening a couple of blocks from our house. Nobody warned us. There's no traffic control. People (tiny people) and cars everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm taking it for the CEUs, so I'm kinda good with whatever. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe. I opt for the pat down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never once stepped into one of those abominations. And I never plan to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a singular topic and 10 minutes is either too long or too short!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has to include prevention, detection, response, and recovery, so this should work well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Response basics, end user device security, "officer creeper" (aka unauthorized people), passwords/password management/2fa, phishing, ransomware, social engineering, social networking. Because those are specific things we covered in class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got one: undetected installation of cryptomining software.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it weren't 15% of my grade, I would consider that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is picking a topic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to put together a 10 minute presentation on an infosec topic (homework). There's a list of things I can't talk about. I've had a blank PPT open on my desktop all day, so now I'm snuggling on the sofa with the cat. Maybe this will create one single usable idea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This happened to me yesterday. Twice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Discovered yesterday that one of my hubcaps is missing. Discovered today that a new one looks like it's $70. Guess I'm going to hit up a wrecking yard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's cool! I have a handheld weather station that lives in my power go-kit. The problem is I have a lot of go-kits for different purposes. They all have a coffee stash though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hippies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She also gets to live with me and/or my brother for 3 weeks this summer, which will also be fun. She's super nerdy and I adore her. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys!!! I'm so excited. My high school freshman niece got accepted into a summer camp that is ground school training! All of it! If she passes the course, she gets 5 high school credits and 5 college credits. 3 weeks of camp that can change her life! FuturePilot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That requires more than one employee though, which the majority of EM organizations don't have. Most are still "other duties" for somebody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some! Condordia in Portland has an amazing lab! Most programs though require internships, so people can get real experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which makes no sense for entry level, since you can't get it without experience. Sounds like a mid-level job with entry pay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, absolutely jobs that prefer or require it. A growing number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is a fair and valid point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who wants to watch a show about going to meetings though? Oh, and occasionally blowing up a building Tommy Lee Jones style. Still my EM hero . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hacker cat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) that cat is huge! 2) he must really like your house. That was a lot of effort for a cat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have three different, complimentary, certifications. One of them is the CEM. For me, the value is in knowing that I'm directly contributing to improving the profession. I learned long so not too try to convince someone of something they've declared they don't like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was only one level of credential for a long time. Now two. Maybe someday three!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a movement afoot to start a caucus for small organizations. It just takes a few people to get things moving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The T&E committee does a lot of work around theory-to-practice, which deals directly with that bridge. As to the rest, new groups start when somebody suggests them, gets other people on-board, then asks to start the group! We're a member driven organization.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you want to get out of your IAEM membership? People find the most value in the caucuses and committees, but only about 1/4 of the members actually join one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, have you thought about joining the CEM Commission? That's where these things get decided!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then there's a third level (Advanced or MasterCard or something) that says "I've really got it".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The CEM was the baseline for a long time. After adding the degree requirement for it though, a lot of people were excluded. The AEM is the entry path to the CEM. This isn't an unusual model in certifications. The first level is "working on it", the middle level is "got it"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mostly because nobody that young in the Army is jovial. They all mostly hate life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought that odd!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week's have been DMing me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm getting a lot of "hi" messages from people like this this week. *sigh*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am doing a trip in June where the weight allowance of everything you have is 20 pounds. It's $1/pound for everything over. My backpack alone weighs 20 pounds . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not so much. They are mostly exposed to live music, from the band. Butters loves the company, but spends most of practice under the bed. And Pixel is nope with everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to leave my YouTube data because it's mostly me playing videos for the cats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we love you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have so many socks when I travel! I think I took 15 pair when we went to Harvey for a week. And I bought travel underwear, that you can easily wash in the sink and have dry by morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting at a Courtyard bar, with other road warriors. Our conversation had turned to which Courtyard does the best Brussels sprouts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whaaaaaaaa?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shout out to humangear where a lifetime warranty is actually a lifetime warranty! I forgot they had it and ended up fishing 2 GoToobs out of the trash once I realized they would just replace the caps I broke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could probably reconstruct most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks auto correct for randomly adding a word<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to several teaching Tacoma games, to cheer for Portland!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I try to go to games wherever I am. Hockey is hockey! I've been to 2 NWHL games. Many NHL games (lots of teams) and several AHL games. I should have started an actual list at some point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh. Portland , Everett (original season), and Seattle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm thinking they need a 4th. Vancouver, BC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so excited for the hockey options we're going to have in Seattle! I've been a TheWHL season ticket holder since 1991 (3 teams). Now we'll have nhl AND NWHL! So many great choices! NHLtoSeattle and NWHLtoSeattle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better than Han and Chewie I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can live without my phone. Other people will die if I don't get my coffee!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Coffee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the hair is so perfect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was an entertaining episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proctoring the iaem CEM exam today at the PIEPC Conference. Somebody left Girl Scout cookies here, which makes it much easier for me to be quiet!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those are my favorite planes! I've gotten so used to rebooting things it didn't bug me. I thought it was funny . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So excited! I've been to two NWHL games. Would be so awesome to have a team here! Though I'm not giving up my Rivs jersey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had to reboot our plane the other night too! Was it one of the old 737-700s?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hmph. amazon finally responded to my complaint about the AmazonKindle app not accepting 2FA. Their response was that I need to call them so they can walk me through "bypassing" the 2FA by "confirming a few account security details" from me. Hard pass. Fix it so it works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes my head hurt. It's also one of the reason I've worked in government most of my life. The pay isn't great, but it's fairly equitable. It's also public record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ground crews are directing traffic around us. Little baggage carts and vehicles scurrying about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New gate, but there's stuff in our way, so now we're sitting here blocking an alleyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landed, but there's a plane at our gate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A notion that gets better with every passing day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That or those crunchy sweet dessert things they used to have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm on the newly redesigned AlaskaAir coach seats. Bulkhead, 6A to be specific. The seat back is cool. The tray table is cool. The seat is the most uncomfortable I've ever had on a full-size plane. The seat has a hard left edge with little padding. Ow. Do not like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Water<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had the same issue with 800 mhz and 4G. That's why the whole rebanding thing happened. Sprint literally killed the ability of public safety to talk on their radios. It's fixed now, but apparently we learned nothing. N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a hard nope amazon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit. I can't justify season tickets to three hockey teams. Which two do I gov with when the time comes??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to know where I can get this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's sort of embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I discovered that Costco sells them in giant quantities. I have to pace myself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know why it took me 10 years to discover LZZYHALE and Halestorm (actually, I blame my brother), but their music makes my life better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed not. It's been 8 months . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to remember to add HBO to one of my streaming services tomorrow. This is critical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We saw a decrease because husband was laid off. Yay economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But you got lotusbiscoff cookies! That makes up for a lot..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, DAD is asleep and either the kid is too or he's playing quietly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty the guy in front of me on the plane named DAD, DAD, DAD is hoping the small person named shhhhhh goes to sleep quickly! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reboot worked. Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reboot complete. We have air and lights again. Waiting to hear if problem was solved. FingersCrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're in a 737-700 tonight. Can't remember the last time I saw one (maybe on the southbound alaskaair milk run?). And now they're literally rebooting the plane. Trying to clear some pesky malfunction light. And my phone just pinged with a 1 hour delay. Hope that's wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hrmm. My backpack doesn't really fit under the seat in front of me anymore. At least not completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's only when the review happens in a specific workplace. Most of the day behavior I see is to indirect colleagues, outside of the immediate workplace. Fewer consequences there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh. Fancy new AlaskaAir seats!! Lady next to me is washing her entire seat and area though, which is very off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weather is ick here. Very windy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other thing that happens is when one person is inappropriate, people feel more free to pick on them. Then things start to escalate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh oh. Just heard them say on the radio that sometime came in contact with the airplane. Has to be inspected before we go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Supposed to start boarding on AlaskaAir for Seattle in 3 minutes. Inbound just got here though. Gonna be late . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey people of EMGTwitter, anybody want to collaborate on a study/paper about some of the horrible ways people treat each other in our profession? I'm thinking survey research, with research based solutions on changing the culture. It's got to change.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Asked a woman EM colleague today about a man EM colleague who emailed me last week (and whom I don't know). I thought she might know him. She said "he's the guy us older women warn the younger women about". Guess she knew him. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I read that like poutine. So like poodium. Like I'm 12.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe that's it! Would make more sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people in Wisconsin say mallware instead of malware? I thought it was just one person, but now I've heard multiple people say it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like it. A lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is more or less the current theme of Star Trek Discovery.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I was cleaning out a bathroom drawer last week and found a whole set of beauty products that were sent to me. It was awesome at the time! Now it's mostly just trash . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>These are the people charged with keeping us safe. Ugh.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's exactly what it tasted like!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make the HDMI port accessible so I can plug my surface into your TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously. I've never had cheese like either of these. The pale one is like Gouda, but that marble in it is spicy. And it's delicious. I may need an intervention by the end of this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's mystery Wisconsin cheese. And it's really good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second Marriott hotel in a row that has a lovely big screen TV in the room with no accessible HDMI port. So I end up watching my shows on my Surface. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some people harass because they're clueless. They can be changed. Some people harass because they're assholes. They can't be changed.

<|startoftext|>Bottom line, harassment is everywhere. It doesn't just happen to women. Recently watched it happen to a millennial man, because he was a millennial.

<|startoftext|>I realized that I would never had kept a job if I had left every time I had been harassed (except for the college job where I washed cars for the sheriff's office).

<|startoftext|>Yesterday somebody (a guy) asked me earnestly why a woman would want to go back to a work environment where she had been harassed.

<|startoftext|>If you've been following along the past 24 hours, you should listen to this hazardspodcast episode on women in Emergency Management. I had the privilege to join SamLMontano, DrNLouissaint, & seeleysue for this. There's both swearing and alcohol involved. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And follow-up to the follow-up, a God a sincere apology this afternoon from the offender. And importantly, I think learning happened and this person might not do this again. Also, he likes podcasts, so I'm sending him *that* podcast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, follow-up. By the time I got to class today, this had been DEALT WITH, by the person who heard it and had the power to deal with it. Faith restored!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I managed to listen to the entire Halestorm collection on Spotify while I was working in my room tonight. First time I've done that. My day became immeasurably better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Gross. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am 100% in on this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Be forced to apologize to somebody (that happened recently). Mostly I'm just pissed. Sexism is so alive and well in our field, I feel like we breed it and nurture it instead of nuking it from orbit. If I bitch, I'll be the removed, not him, because he's the customer. Ugh. 9/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pissed because if he'll say that in public, he probably says worse in private. I'm pissed because he also went on a rant about transgender athletes that was BS (yes, I spoke up on that). I'm pissed because someone will probably get butthurt over this thread and I'll 8/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pissed I didn't say "that was inappropriate". I'm pissed that part of my thinking was whether I'd get canned for making waves. I'm pissed nobody else said anything. I'm pissed I'm going to have to see him every day for a week. I'm pissed that his employer employs him. 7/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After we were done for the day, I talked to the other woman that was there to confirm that I didn't hear things wrong. I did not. She repeated verbatim what she heard from dude bro. I'm so pissed. I'm pissed he said it, over my literal protestations. 6/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I started saying no over the top of his commentary, which became NO, which became "THAT IS NOT ME". He finished his "punchline" after my protests. Then there was awkward silence and somebody changed the topic. 5/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I'm relating my story to some emgtwitter colleagues at the class ( not class members). Dude bro "professional" starts laughing with everybody else, then adds his own commentary, about how I was just wearing a bath towel that I let slip off when maintenance got there. 4/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to call the front desk, who had to send maintenance. It turns out those knobs with the symbols are buttons, not knobs. Dude pushes the button and water magically appears! He was kind enough not to laugh at me. :) 3/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanted to fill the bathroom with steam and hang my clothes in there because I'm too lazy to iron. I could NOT figure out how to turn the shower on. There was an assortment of knobs and dials, but no combo made water come out! 2/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a story that starts funny and ends with something unfunny. I'm traveling for work this week, teaching a class. I got a really nice hotel upgrade to an exec suite.

<|startoftext|>It was very confusing for my local police department, but they took my report. Turns out the person's child had a restraining order against them. They were bad news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, the part about cheese made me realize I'm hungry and have no snacks in the hotel room (yet).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just woke up from a hotel room nap (on a sofa no less). This resonates. . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Absolutely yes. I reported one to local authorities about a year ago. The person I reported resurfaced about a month ago, carrying on about me again. Creepy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The value of the organization is largely in it's caucuses though. That's where people find common interests. The new job board offers third party refine reviews too, though it's only been live for a couple of weeks, so I haven't talked to anyone who's used it yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I chaired the most recent student membership task force as well and that report has gone to the board for action. It takes a while to percolate through the bureaucracy though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been a topic of discussion. Like everything else we do, it's member driven. If 20 people put together and issue paper and want to start a new professionals caucus, I'm certain it would be supported! Nobody has formally proposed one yet though, so nothing for Board to act on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry about the website crash! We've had some issues with the rollout of the new one. We had some real challenges with communication over the last couple of years, but that been fixed. We had our first ever Region X conference call meeting on Monday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, you're looking at the new wave of leadership!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's March. There should not be ice on my window.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was nothing you could assist me with. My order was cancelled. I ate something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, but all the users on each team have to be part of the same domain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There did seem to be some sort of work around based on Skype for Business. I concluded it was far more work than I was interested in n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Slack. Maybe too much. I have 9 instances on my primary computer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's for something else! But without cross domain ability, not really useful to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may be a moot question. Teams isn't cross-domain from what I can see..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey friends, thoughts on whether Slack or MS Teams is better? Or one better for certain things?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As long as it's not a sweary sheep, you're fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had State Department friends stationed there for two years. They brought me back this guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have business class, which works really well, 99% of the time. They've been really good. This issue though is more complex apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're near Albuquerque and into SMEM, DisasterCTR is bringing their Engagement Strategies course to you next month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. Husband also network engineer. Very frustrated network engineer at the moment. Comcast support certain this is equipment problem. Send guy with new equipment. Probably a provisioning problem, but support doesn't seem to comprehend. Usually their biz SLA is ok. Not today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We'll see how this turns out. But it really seems like not all your people are on the same page as it relates to your business services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband made many phone calls yesterday to confirm that we can do this and everyone in customer service said yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Not good. Tech is insisting that since we have static IPV4 addresses, we can't have IPV6, in spite of the fact that we did for a long time (until they gave us this newest modem). He just called HQ to say someone else needs to deal with us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. The comcast guy is here to replace our misbehaving modem. Husband is patiently explaining to him that you can in fact have IVP4 and IVP6 on the same device.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They go where I need to go without connecting. I hate connecting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. No consistency then. They're still my fav though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah, that. There used to be one brand and it was called Reverse 911. Modern systems use phone, text, and apps and often have APIs for social media..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No, we just all enjoyed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flying over Seattle tonight, we got to see the coolest thing. It was another AlaskaAir flight, lower than is and to the left, probably headed for Boeing Field, but it looked like it was hovering in mid-air. We all agreed we had never seen that before!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course! Here's a cat I met in Puerto Rico this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two weeks ago it was snowing. WTF? The last time I remember having this many fires this early we nearly burned the state down (2015).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's time to delete WhatsApp. I've used it twice ever and now that it's been gobbled up by the insecure overlords, I feel it should go. I can use that extra space for cat pics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bah!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have questions. 1) how did you get any of my data. I've never shopped with you. 2) what data did you have on me. 3) why did I hear about this from a 3rd party and not from you. 4) What have to done to prevent this from happening again? Feel free to answer publicly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. This now makes sense, but in a bad way. HauteLook is owned by nordstrom. I've never shopped at former, but I have at the latter. And I used this address for e-receipts. Any comment Nordstrom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate being pwned in things I've never heard of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This shirt is a great conversation starter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I learned that you can't connect from A Gates to D Gates at BWI without leaving security. Which means I could have bought that rum, checked my bag, retrieved it, and rechecked it and it wouldn't have really been any extra hassle. Now I'm kind of sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No change = bigger tip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how cabs never have change either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And apparently this is the only cab driver on the planet that follows the speed limit. We're camped in the left lane of the freeway, being passed on the right by literally everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate taxis. Hotel told me I wouldn't find an Uber this early. They weren't wrong. They arranged a taxi, which I told them had to take credit cards. Guess what? It doesn't. This guy is lucky I carry emergency cash.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sometimes it just is what it is, but other times, there's an artificial barrier to entry that can be eliminated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For me, the fundamental question to be asked is "is there some barrier to entry that prevents people from serving?". One group I was in, it was their monthly required dues, which were out of reach of the people they were most interested in attracting.n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Diverse in terms of representing a group of people that is not all white. I have a strong feeling that smaller groups who represent larger groups should reflect the overall composition of those groups. When they don't, there's an inherent mismatch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wanna make people mad? Point out to a group of white people that they're not diverse. They will spend much time telling you how diverse they are. For a group of white people. And they will get mad at you. Happens every single time. Have done this multiple times with same results.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yikes. Worst traffic I can remember seeing at SeaTacAirport. Inbound lanes are all basically stopped. I left a lot of time, but now worrying it won't be enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grrrr. On-point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. The message is in-point, but the mechanism is bad. Like all those EMs have time for extra phone calls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alaska assured me I will not need my passport in order to fly, but I have to check-in in-person. Boo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, WTF AlaskaAir. Trying to check-in for my SEA->ORD->SJU flight tomorrow (@AmericanAir codeshare). Won't let me check-in because I need to present international travel docs. None of those are international locations. Don't need my passport for a US territory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow my migraine prescription expired. I could have sworn I renewed it on of the 4 trips I made to the doc since December. But no. Damnit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was exactly my issue. Twitter barf I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Used my e-mail address instead of my username and got in. Still very strange.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can't login to Twitter from a desktop, using either direct login or TweetDeck. Multiple browsers. Multiple computers. Tried from mobile browser, got this. Can't get past it because it says my phone number is on more than one account. Probably true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This was a pleasant read for a dreary week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't disagree with any of that. In this particular case, many of them were originally paper, so would have required scanning. It was the nature of what they asked for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This ends up going both ways. I had to respond to an extensive records request once. Spent many hours on it, as did others. Requestor never came and got it. Hundreds of dollars in wasted time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pre-check changed my life. And was far less intrusive than most of the background checks I've had. I upgraded to Global Entry, which was worth the extra hassle too. Life is too short to spend it in longgggg lines!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It feels like we're stuck in a horror movie. I absolutely think it's worse. The fact that he did it is horrible. That he had a willing and enthusiastic audience is terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been sitting here for the past couple of hours, contemplating what it means that a horrific event was live-streamed by the perpetrator, he announced it in advance, and he had a lot of people cheer him on. My brain doesn't want to believe, but here we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And posted in advance about it on 8chan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is it that SeattleTbirds are the most penalized team in the entire TheWHL this season??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I know. Hence me trying to figure out what kind of plane my flight is on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They haven't told me they've cancelled my flight, but there's a big alert in the app telling me I can rebook. I don't know if they're trying to tell me I have to or if it's just a general message<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only 35 of their planes are 737 Max.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the 737 Max, yes, but I can't figure out if that's what this plane is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't fly SouthwestAir that often. But I am next week. How do I figure out if my flight is on a 737 Max? Nothing in the app seems to tell me what type of plane I'm on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not only the bartender but the restaurant owner as well. That's the law. That's why alcohol servers have to be trained and licensed, as do the bars that employ them.

<|startoftext|>Sometimes jumping in and pointing out that positive change is happening is not worth it. And I hate the Internet sometimes. Maybe most times. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was pointing out that not every sex worker every time is arrested. I pointed to the Seattle case(s) as evidence of that. I'm making the point that some parts of the country are treating these cases differently. I don't need to engage in debate about it. At all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm talking about the Seattle case and have been the whole time. I'm not arguing the Florida case at all. I've read both articles. Florida = arrests. Seattle = services and visas and no arrests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, it says 5 people were arrested. None of them being the sex workers. The Stranger is typically pretty accurate on such things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's also quoted in the Stranger article, which makes no mention of any of the sex workers being arrested. I do doubt your take, based on the fact that Visas are being sought for them. Being charged with a crime generally removes the possibility of a visa from the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's your source for the part where they were arrested at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, can you point me to your source for the Seattle incident that says they were all arrested? I'd like to read the counter narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So i'm confused. You read the article I posted, that said they were not arrested, were offered assistance, and were told they're not being deported, and you're saying that either didn't happen or isn't true?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the same job, opening to all candidates:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your free airport shuttle at MCI was completely full, with people standing. I had to get an Uber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ewwww.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The magic of overly complicated airplanes . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm usually traveling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My ultimate goal is to show up with a gaggle of my GeorgetownEDM Risk Perception students. I think we'd have a great time at ICRC_Conference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I intercept with an outstretched hand. And it wouldn't matter to me if it was a man or a woman. NotAHugger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, we're not good at nuance in general when it comes to things that people equate with moral issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wanted to go to this! I'm enjoying your tweets from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it turns out that trying to find the answer on a tiny screen using airplane WiFi is inefficient. But I will find the answer when I'm back in solid ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly don't know. I'll have to find out! I suspect it may vary by country. I can imagine in some countries they would not be allowed to exist with such a policy in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This last year, there was new training for leads and a process for suspected trafficking victims because a couple were rescued the year before. Somebody realized we were in unique position to help, but only if we didn't screw it up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are so many anti-trafficking things quietly going on out there. Most of them slide under the radar, which is how they can remain effective. I volunteer at an annual free clinic that serves thousands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the organization I volunteer with is soroptimist. I'm the current president of sicascadia. Our primary focus is improving the lives of women and girls, but out of that has evolved a wide array of trafficking education and policy initiatives globally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't work directly with survivors. I work at education of policy makers and others outside, and to raise funds for agencies that provide direct service. So, to the best of my knowledge, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know why this is popping up in my feed today, but it's hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes my nephew's stories of Army life baffle me. He's a combat medic. Somebody in his troop got hurt. His NCO wouldn't let him treat because he's a PFC. Why invest all that time in training someone and then not put them to work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the perks of being a professor, even part-time: books!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also a large one in Tukwila called Operation Dirty Boulevard that happened in 2013. Focus wasn't on sex trafficking, but many of those displaced were likely trafficking victims and all were provided social services instead of criminal charges. Except for the actual criminals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I posted the link somewhere in this thread, but the most recent was three days ago. Covered in the PI and other outlets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. I work with a nonprofit that does a lot of education about human trafficking. It's sometimes very hard to change people's minds and get them to view trafficked people first as people, then as survivors/victims. Some people can't get past what they see as a crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. I think the approach changes dramatically depending on what part of the country you're in. Some places are more inclined to treat people humanely than others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not universally true. A ring was just broken up in Seattle and those women were not charged with crimes. They were connected with social services and help. Some places recognize that trafficked people are not criminals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, hey, there were walnuts hiding under my grapes. Hopefully the grapes weren't contaminated. I'll let you know in a few minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this should have been inserted in the timeline here. I just didn't fully grasp that this would be an adventure tweet kind of trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This yogurt might thaw by the time we get to Seattle! It is VERY frozen. Flight attendant pulled it off dry ice about 90 minutes ago when she got on-board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to ask AlaskaAir to turn this plane around and take me back to the warmth of Kansas City. Who would have thought that would be a thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a reasonable action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently this is not my day. Somehow most of my leg just got sprayed down with a can of Coke from the row in front of me. Luckily I'm wearing blue jeans and not my khakis. I have to go to a meeting as soon as I land.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is only the second thing I've ever had confiscated. Both were at small airports. The other was a nail file. The agent was an ass and insisted it was a knife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My key-knife in the backpack experiment lasted just over three years. So roughly 350,000 miles flown with it. Today it met it's fate at MCI. I will miss you, great cutter of limes and tape. I doubt anyone around me on a plane will suddenly feel safer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Didn't have to do the shoes thing since I have pre-check. But yeah, the line. And my bag got searched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's a non-precheck airport. I'm not sure I remember how to do this . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Marriott airport shuttle full. Have to take a rideshare. Not the way to start a long day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! I'm going to pass that one along.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I like this idea. Pick a time and just stick with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TSA pre-check line this morning at SEA. Old duffer in front of me gets his bag snagged. "Is there anything sharp or dangerous in there sir?" "No. Why? .... I've just got some vodka in there." And now he doesn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Needless to say I refused to discipline anybody, and wrote a scathing email to my boss and HR pointing out that this was a horrible idea and that these should never be used for discipline unless the person reading them understood what they were reading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So critical. I was directed to discipline an employee once for "spending too much time on the internet". I reviewed the (printed) logs myself and discovered that they were including all the time the cookies recorded. So 6 minutes on a page with 10 cookies looked like an hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, I feel very appreciated now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The recent snowstorm we had here showed that we HAVE moved the needle. The people who were stuck the longest needed almost no assistance. Not because they had kits, but because they were actually prepared. These aren't the people who mobbed Costco BTW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This all boils down to risk perception. The brain automatically says "yeah, I get that other people have risk from this thread, but I'm fine". Until they personalize it, it's just noise. And like MaryJoFly said, "build a kit" is the wrong message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out it was confetti of happiness tonight.<|endoftext|>

My colleague got back from his run and very awkwardly asked me why I had a mountain of flowers. 4/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the guys in the group walked over with a good sized unmarked box and plopped it on my table. He lead with something like "I hope this isn't weird . . ." Turns out the box was full of pink carnations. The group was a bunch of florists, attending a florist convention. 3/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was a large, rowdy group of people having a very good time. I assumed from their drunk, profanity laden, hilarious conversation that they must be lobbyists. They had opinions about a great many things. 2/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mildly funny InternationalWomensDay story. A few years ago I was at my fav people watching hotel bar in DC. My colleague was out for a run, so I was having a drink and people watching. 1/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it was just a little high stick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also what it looked like from here. And everywhere else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd be happy to just sit behind him one night. Guaranteed I can make more miserable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cupcakes and Ding Dongs tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there he was, but not too be out done by the 'Mericans at the other end . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This starting lineup says something. And that something is "we're going to kick your ass".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a US/Canada game. I assume the defender of the patriarchy will be bellowing again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would do the same!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I quit reading them years ago, unless it's for a new class or a new-to-me class that I'm going to teach again. They typically don't add any value to my life or my teaching. Somebody loves me, somebody hates me, 2/3 of them didn't response to the survey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It warmed up to 39 and it's all gone. Sorry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to retract this slightly. It IS CURRENTLY SNOWING.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the best new Twitter account. HappyFriday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's time for Equifax to just die. Their commercial about their dark web "triple scan" is a weird fear mongering thing. And their inability to keep anything secure is almost laughable at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It snowed again last night. wawx auburnwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not if they involve actually going all the way to UW campus! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang. FedEx just called me on the phone to let me know they were for sure able to reroute the package. That's some of the best customer service I've ever seen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have hauled my luggage to all sorts of places in DC. I agree with your theory!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've worn glasses since I was 4. They're just an extension of my face at this point. Progressive trifocals make my life better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh god. Our house is littered with the things. I am unclear why my husband needs 500 pair of the them, but I find them in chairs, in all the bathrooms, in the shower, in the kitchen, in the car, in his office, in my office. This is the problem with Costco multi-packs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like tomorrow is going to be an interesting weather day. Snow and thunder. But not thundersnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear infosec world, my husband needs a job. And more importantly, I need him to have a job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a new spoon rest to go by the coffee maker. LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except for the whole "it's March and there should be flowers blooming" part. My poor camellia seems to have abandoned all hope. It usually starts to bloom in Jan, but being smashed by the tree slowed it down. Then first bloom froze to death in Feb. It just tried 2 more and snow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: it's snowing on the valley floor (#auburnwa) and sticking to the grass and things that aren't concrete. Temp has been bouncing between 32 and 34. wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying to update the community discussion I started on it. I can longer login to the community site. And I receive the message that I pasted above. My ticket is closed, but you seem to have a larger problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear ArloSmartHome, your site is broken and is leaking error messages ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys, it's snowing again. In Puget Sound. In March. wawx FederalWay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And amazon FedEx are pretty awesome. We got one of the packages rerouted to a holding location in the general vicinity of the new sucky place ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nephew (Sunday): OMG the Army sent me here and it sucks and I'm bored and my roommate is an idiot and we're going to be here for months. Me: Ok, i'll send you books to keep you company. Nephew today: yeah, so we're leaving this sucky place in the morning. Me: The books! :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was gone for 5 hours. ButtersOK missed me VERY MUCH!! LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing he asked somebody, just based on the level of detail he provided. Which circles back to a lack of policy and guidance by the company. A grocery store shouldn't be trying to provide education on security. They should know that and make sure their employees know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've written plenty of guidance and trained many CS people in both technical and non-technical roles, including life safety positions. I've fired people for not following that guidance. It's on the company if they dump people into roles without adequate prep/training/guidance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. They're not an expert in that topic. They should have clear guidance that they are not to address things they do not know anything about and they should have a process for who to go to with questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The employee for not recognizing his lack of expertise and either delaying an answer until he could get an official answer or referring people to someone who has the answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree he handled it well after he ventured into territory he had no business in. Cluelessness from my perspective is not a reference to intellect. In this case, it's both a reflection on the company having bad polices and guidance for their public facing employees and on 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First rule of being the spokesperson though is to stay in your lane. If you don't know the answer, you find someone who does, even if you have to say "hey, I don't know, but let me find out".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Really, just wow. The level of clueless here is overwhelming . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interestingly, original tweet was deleted. New one posted to correct the tag for their governor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that 2 minute bench minor was for "lippy coach".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, that was 4 minutes for being Richards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was sort of hoping for review so the league could see the level of horrible call that was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that still an auto review for supplemental discipline?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 10 years of waiting for the US to get its act together, a friend of mine quit his job, moved 3 hours north to Vancouver, BC, and started his own company. Which is successful and has several employees. He wanted to do it in the US, but finally gave up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This! I finally got my dad (in his 79s) to fact check via me. He won't use Snopes or any other fact check sites (can't be trusted you know), but he'll at least check with me before posting crap on FB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't help. And I'm trying to use the email support and there's no option to select for help with an app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She = mom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so sorry. My brother is bipolar. She never acknowledged it when he was a teen. He finally got his own help, but she still asks when he'll be able to stop taking his medication. I too want to be angry. Mostly I'm sad that she can't just accept he has a treatable illness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. ArloSmartHome Android app is driving me crazy. It's literally either double or nothing. Either I get two notices of everything or none. Can't find the right combo of settings to get me one notification.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The last of that AlaskaAir cup of coffee was a little crunchy . . . iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other piece that's usually missing is any understanding in infosec of risk communication. The "do it because I said so" approach almost never works. There's plenty of knowledge in the risk comm world to help fix this, but doesn't get used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are my favorite parts of security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is alarming. Alaska has become the canary of climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good part is that his table mates (all younger men) were having none of it. Most of it was said to them, not the class, and they did their own culling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was the instructor. I may be again in the future. If I am, my week will start with a conversation with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found them in Wisconsin this week. Soooooo good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad I follow you. This was exactly the laugh my week needed to end on!;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have one of these, so, ya know, it's cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG want!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow I missed that BotSentinel existed until today. So useful! smem and EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Random hockey game on TV at hotel bar. Serious question:: are the NJDevils trying to look like Christmas trees?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>300 bunnies people! That goes beyond overcrowding. Poor bunbuns. Maybe you need a bunny in your life??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, if I go back, my week is going to start by having a conversation with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The group has exiled him. They won't get back together for another month, but his tablemates were pretty clear on their thoughts n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wheels of justice turn slowly sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, just talked about it with my co-instructor. I don't know if I'll be back, but she will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not my call. It's going in the after action though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Example: "my daughter had a miniature donkey that won a prize. I told her she had the best little ass in XX". vomit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were no scores like that, but he irritated security so badly that the entire class is being punished with extra security measures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a horrible mysogenistc dude in the class I'm teaching. It's gotten worse all week as he's gotten more comfortable. TGIF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmm hmmmm. I slid our rental car into a curb there. Thanks for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know it's time to go home when you start to think of 25 degrees as "warmed up"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You only say this because you've not watched WHL referees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've been waiting for you to get your cake!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm the oldest of five. I have neither a GED or high school diploma. The 4 behind me have GEDs. It's worked out fine for me and I have no regrets, though I hid it for a long time. I almost finished my PhD, but I don't regret dropping out of that either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Blergh. Chipping off my car windows so I could go to work today is going to catch up with me later. Pretty sure my shoulder is going to stage a major protest tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So essentially the same findings Miletti had, oh so many years ago. There's a reason we still make students and practitioners read his work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A portilloshotdog opened in Madison yesterday. Guess what I'm having for dinner tonight??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all in the approach! If they retire from one profession and embrace EM as a new profession, that's a different thing than treating it like an extension of their old one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get so frustrated watching friends who can never be promoted, no matter how good they are, because the top job has to have a badge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. Giant doggo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is he? Golden lab?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those disasters create political buy-in, which creates funds. It's hard to create buy-in for hypotheticals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG Doc is soooo adorable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also this! Get EM out of commissioned/sworn ranks AND quit making it a retirement gig. If every new EM had to go to basic Academy, the retirees would quit wanting the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have more disasters? That's the only reason there are career paths in those parts of the country. When you're a 1 or 2 person shop, there's no room for entry level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's mostly in this part of the country. South and east have entry level jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've stayed in this brand multiple times and always had a microwave. Not sure what's up with that. But I'm good! It's bedtime now and I'm not hungry. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Less, because I bought at the drug store not the hotel lobby!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could, but who gets a personal sized pizza delivered? This room has a fridge but no microwave, so no way to heat leftovers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hotel room dinner so far has been Fritolay Fritos and a mini MoonPie. I bought some jalapeno peanut mmschocolate I might try too. Or maybe OrigCupNoodles I can make with coffee pot water. It's 10 degrees outside and I'm NOT going back out. JudgeMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I already talked to them. They're making the driver come back and actually follow the delivery instructions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your own super crappy one. They NEVER follow instructions. EVER. And today I can't even see that they even tried to deliver it. To say that there was no safe place to leave it is crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does amazon have the worst delivery service ever? Why today did you decide there was no safe place to leave things, once again ignoring my delivery instructions? And somebody was home all day too, so you just had to knock or ring the bell. Get drivers who can read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this pretty much made my day! RealSexyCyborg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paramedic. Because Emergency. I ended up being a wildness medic, 911 dispatcher, and now emergency manager. Same relative field at least!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Brrrrrrrrrr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw you! We were directed out there because there was too much traffic in the alley. Just security vehicles then. In way to rental car we drove by and I could see the light show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Wisconsin, your beer and mac n cheese have not disappointed. Your Sub-Zero wind-chill however can bite me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was that you guys parked out in the hinterlands for more than an hour, surrounded by everything with a flashing light?? The retro livery would explain why I couldn't figure out what airline that was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe. It's been there almost an hour now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Something exciting is happening at ORD. Plane pulled out into the hinterlands, surrounded by police, fire, security, all with lights flashing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I know that guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in typical ORD fashion, we're now going to park in the tarmac hinterlands while we wait for alley traffic to clear . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so a little more than hype. On the ground , the wind is rocking the plane every time we stop n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's one called earthquake that has a seismograph line. Wine is ok. bottle is awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out it was all hype.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pilot: the front has moved on, but we'll be landing in 25-45 MPH winds. It might get a little bumpy. Everyone (on the inside): no shit WelcomeToChicago<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nice!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We've lived in our house for 15 years. 2 weeks ago, he apparently watched my look out the front door for the first time, which involves me on my tiptoes, plus a little hop. He laughed, but also realized why I like having a security camera on the front porch. Only way I can see!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both my husband (6'6") and a colleague sent me this yesterday. It all rings so true. I remember having a ballistic vest that wasn't going to stop anything because boobs. Any nobody cared except the people with boobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatcha doing on the other side??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm driving to Madison, so I'll probably freeze to death anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me as an undergrad and master's student: OMG I missed a point!! Me as a graduate certificate student: Hmm. I need 70% on this mid-term exam and the final to pass the class. HEY, I got 85% on the mid-term. Now I don't even have to study for the final!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm about to land there in two hours. Gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've made a terrible decision. If I freeze to death, it was nice knowing you all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not easily. And not routinely. But ultimately, when enough people want to make it happen and they work together, yes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yep, King County. All the east cites cities and unincorporated areas. 4 feet of snow on the roads in places and no way to move it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not until we move the 4 feet of snow on roads in some places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 5 of EOC snow response. This might go on for many more days. East county is really bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was a most fortuitous decision. Probably saved me from crashing this morning on the freeway. Went sideways instead of spinning around on an icy patch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmm. I could eat a lot of those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think there's freezing rain outside right now. I am unamused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thing I got 480 pounds of sand for the back of my truck. I get to drive to the EOC tomorrow morning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Last week, Zelda died of old age. Clover lost her mind. She cried and cried, all through the night, in her goat barn. Every time she saw a person, she yelled at them to come be with her. She got so desperate to not be alone that when she saw a jogger, she vaulted her fence 2/6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a sad story about a goat, but it has a happy ending. My Niece had a goat named Zelda. A couple of years ago, Zelda had a baby named Clover. Clover and Niece are best buddies, to the point that Clover thinks she's a people. Clover spent every day with her mom, Zelda. 1/6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, yeah. I had to tell my students the other day that my bachelor's thesis was not available to share electronically. Though it was produced on an early 90s word processor, I only have a paper copy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do this for my students for APA. No sense in making them try to figure it out the hard way!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Every city posts about their streets, the county about theirs, and the state and theirs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my preference. In my backpack, suitcase, and cupboard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most cities are updating via their website and social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was about to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: temporary repairs made. Coffee roasting is underway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys, this is a serious emergency. Our coffee roaster broke and WE ARE OUT OF ROASTED COFFEE! Emergency repairs are underway. Thoughts and prayers are needed. snowmageddon2019 EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This was the fountain at about 0130.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We drove the speed limit from Showware to home, basically up central to Auburn way. The hard part was getting in the garage. I can't make the corner in 4WD because it won't turn sharp enough, but I needed the front wheels to push me in. Took two shots, but it's in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fountain looks lovely. SnowMageddon2019 AuburnWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, we wouldn't be here if there were any hills involved.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm doing primary trouble-shooting to solve basic issues and to figure out what we actually need to ask for once it's escalated. "It doesn't work" isn't all that helpful and I have the time to help figure that out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We just escalate those things to the county admin. We have a very large implementation, that covers the whole county and all 39 cities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wahahahahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also little things, like one agency who logged in and all their permission are messed up. Their site-admin is stuck in DC, trying to get home from EMI!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That luckily is not one of our issues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, which is all out of my hands. I'm helping with basic things like "you have to login, then sign-in". Which is confusing as hell to people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snowageddon. Our first big activation county-wide since we got WebEOC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear WebEOC might be the death of me today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I'm thinking this could be an interesting defcon talk ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly how it might affect them. That can be the trusted messenger explaining their own experience. Another tactic is showing how their action (or lack) affects the people they care about. My Aunt enabled 2FA after understanding risk to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I teach an entire graduate class on this exact topic! it is the bane of risk communicators everywhere. Part of the solution is for the message to come from people they perceive to be like themselves. And part of it is for them to see or experience a clear illustration of 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have to personalize it. Most people hear the risk and ascribe it to somebody who isn't them. They understand that there is risk, but internal bias tells them they are safe from it, but other people should definitely be taking action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I'm both an emergency manager and a cybersecurity manager! The parallels are striking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, this isn't panic! Panic is a lack of constructive action. People are taking steps in relation to the storm that they believe are needed to keep themselves safe and/or comfortable. That's the opposite of panic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and no. People perceive this to be a huge risk to them, so they take action. They don't perceive an earthquake to be an actual risk, since they can't see it or any evidence of it. So their internal bias tells them they're safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just hope the earthquake that could actually hurt people happens next week, while everybody is still stocked up .... 3/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Particularly perplexing is that even risk events with minor physical consequences often elicit strong public concern and produce extraordinarily severe social impacts, at levels unanticipated by conventional risk analysis" (Kasperson et al., 1988). 2/3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kershaw makes a non-assisted opening knife. I has one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. And since we have a quorem, it is decided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I'm more saying if you don't have a plan, and you haven't tested a plan, the resources don't matter much since you don't know how to access them our utilize them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, not so much. You have to have a plan to know what to ask for. Our state has a response team, but you have to ask for it . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My smallest city is 7000, my largest about 110k.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a medium city with a fairly small government. Pretty typically of Seattle suburbs. Very wealthy and everybody commutes elsewhere to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is basically an annual event, but it's more a tabletop and the people who might get the most from it don't come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About 65K.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is. A request was made today, through non-standard channels, to get some resources. And they're getting help. But had there been a plan, tested and vetted through both IT and EM, I think maybe it would't have taken a week AND it might have gone through the normal channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By way of example, this current city has one IT staff person right now (sounds like maybe the other one quit mid-incident). They have to reimage 120 machines and rebuild their network infrastructure. And those things have been gone for a week now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So for instance, if the water system can't distribute water anymore due to a cyber incident, ICT is going to fix that, but they're not going to arrange for shelters, water delivery, hospital re-routes/shutdowns, etc. That piece of consequence management falls to EM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a lot of really small cities around me. They might have one person to do their "computer stuff". And that person is good at that job until something really bad happens. And they usually don't have the skills to deal with the human impacts to either employees or the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also by "you" I meant the organization's overall plans, not any specific silo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If planning is not done collaboratively with EM, there's no clear path to the consequence management of the stuff that goes beyond the ICT sphere. And worse yet, small cities often have no plans at all. EM can get the discussion started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That has to be part of the discussion. One of the biggest problems I've seen in small orgs is that ICT doesn't recognize the complete impact of failure, nor do they have the responsibility or ability it deal with the cascsding consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Planning template, since people asked:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I've have a public link, which I'm trying to find!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a handy template for planning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. Snow! Doesn't look like very much though. wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emergency managers, you need to go see your IT people today and talk about your plans for a cybersecurity incident. City near me has been down for a week after a ransomware attack. They don't have the resources they need or a tested plan to get them. EMGTwitter cybersecurity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So Microsoft thinks reserving 14% of my Surface drive is somehow helpful to me? Are they going to just delete stuff until they find that much free space? I know they're not forcing it on existing machines yet, but what happens when they do?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our AlaskaAir flight is supposed to take off in about an hour. That giant orange band is supposed to get here about the same time. This should be fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely, comfy bed in a nice hotel last night. And I Could. Not. Sleep. I think my 12 hour Sudafed lasted 24. So now I'm flying home on zero sleep. Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is the way of technology!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I want to delete this tweet because the site is back up but people are still retweeting this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, it started working again this morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't even get certified by FEMA to teach the lower ones. We do a 6 hour 100/200/700 combo course, but you still have to do the tests online<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And lots of places don't do the classroom version.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's back up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also had to point out that for my class, they're required to reference the material, but not take the test. Too many cheat sites create integrity issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, it was one of my students who let me know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you try to actually take a test? I got all the way to putting in my SID and name before it failed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Let's you enter your SID and last name, then errors out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The FEMA_EMI independent study test site is down. Now nobody can take their federally mandated training. Without the training, local/county/state justifications can't meet their grant requirements. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ugh. I'm paying $1300 per month for insurance and we had to also pay $3000 out of pocket before the insurance pays anything. Every service and scrip has a negotiated price, so at least my scrips were fairly cheap until we hit the $3000.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes! I was 16, I did CPR on my terminally ill neighbor. She had DNR, but her husband said he wanted to try CPR and didn't mention the DNR. We lived in BFE, so I did CPR for a long time before the rescue squad got there, then they did CPR until ALS got there and figured it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That poor fir tree got hit by lightning in 2009 and lost about 15 feet off the top. Now its buddy the cedar tree ripped most the branches of the east side. Poor tree.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's over trunk of a multi trunk cedar. The other trunks are still standing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brother got better light on it once he got there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't look like it in the dark. My brother called about 5 to say he thought the tree was in danger of shifting. He had rigging and was making a plan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's going to be some damage. I'm not there though, so I'm waiting on a report!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Highest gust we recorded on Auburn was 42, but turn a tree fell on the house and the power went out. While we were out checking damage, gust easily 50+.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the brother already has plans to enlist the help of PFC Nephew, who is conveniently stationed nearby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the local EM for several years, this is not the first time I've left him to deal with cleanup! But my brother is coming to help, so at least he won't be alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're good. Rando banged on our door a bit ago to let us know there was a tree on our house. Um, yeah, we know. But thanks! And pse says power should be back on by 0430. Brother will be here at daylight to help with tree<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The game I was playing was one I helped fund through a crowdsource project. I think they might actually care!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I reported it in the play store as well. It's pretty ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My guess is that if this continues, the airlines will tell the feds to bugger off and will hire their own security forces in order to keep airports running. Expensive, but less so than shutting it all down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Followed ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes indeed! So many murders. A near daily event. It's also a cheap way of keeping ButtersOK and friends entertained. So many cat chirps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have massive roosts all around us. Dusk in A town is full of crows headed to roost. I guess maybe they just really liked the chickpeas I threw out for them yesterday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm fascinated by crows. Yesterday I threw some treats out for them and refilled all my bird feeders. There are probably 30 or more crows in my yard right now and some of them are eating the suet blocks. I've never had crows eat suet before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my relatives is on lithium for bi-polar disorder. They're doing great! It's a huge relief knowing they'll probably never call me again to say they're going to kill themself. Brain meds not only help the patient, but the people in their lives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lovely sunrise on my AmericanAir AlaskaAir code-share flight this morning. Got me to 75k too! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my assumption is that when they deleted the type of luxury car I had selected from their inventory, it defaulted to their standard luxury vehicle, which they erroneously have coded as a freaking pickup. Pretty sure nobody I could tell would be able to fix that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently nobody has the jag! But to swap it for a pickup???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, we're not getting a Jaguar because he can't pick that option,. We're getting a BMW or an Audi and it's $70 less, but the same number of points. I gotta say I'm a little bummed about the Jag because that sounded like fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy is being helpful. But their system shows no changes were ever made to the reservation. So he's trying to figure out what vehicle class the original was so he can try to fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. WHen I click the button in the app to call for reservations, the message says "than you for calling the mobile app assist desk".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I'm going to try calling. I'm sure this is going to go great ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He can't try to switch it to the right vehicle since I reserved it using points. Points reservations "can't be modified in any way", which is clearly not true side somebody changed it from a Jaguar to a pickup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He says all I can do is cancel my reservation and try my luck again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roberto says he can't help me. He can't answer any of my questions and he recommends I call customer service. WTF is live chat customer service even for if they can't do anything Avis ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This time Roberto is going to help me. And his first question is to ask what I need. Which I literally typed already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An agent accepted, I got the message they would be happy to assist me, then they disconnected. Trying again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. They have live chat support on their website. I have clicked the button..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So for Christmas I used my Avis points to rent a spiffy little Jaguar in Florida. I just logged into my account to look at something and discovered they changed my reservation to a mid-size pickup. How the hell does that even happen??? fail tryharder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They moved us to another gate and we got on the plane that was supposed to go to Houston. The Houston people were moved to our old gate to wait for a plane . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They're waiting for our plane to get clearance to taxi over from the hanger. Then they have to prep it. Same story as the flight that got me here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now it's time for my connecting united flight to board. Not only is there no plane but the previously boarded plane is still at the gate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Drunk girl is all of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. And this was our goalie doing a sprint. Not an easy task!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang. Hughes had some wheels there. Trying to avoid too many men, but holy crap was he fast.n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it also helps that we've occupied these seats for 7 years without incident.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear god.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pvt. Nephew said something about how much he liked the raspberry drink in his MRE. Today he got this. I'm once again in contention for Aunt of the Year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could have at least had Burgerville!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exciting people that we are, we're spending our anniversary in our sweats, eating pizza, drinking beer, and watching football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crawling around under my desk to install UPS and do some cable management. Forgot I lowered the desk and cracked my head on it. Beer is now required.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my good friends is down there with ASPCA disaster response. So many animals being found!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, but no code share flights and it's not an international trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now if I could just figure out how to get to Puerto Rico and earn Alaska miles. No code-shares go there. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oddly, I'm coming back on that trip via an Alaska/American code-share combo. So it's literally just a one time thing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a sad turn of events, I have to fly United later this month. There are some places AlaskaAir just can't get you to. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The A stands for American. They would have no cause to issue statements about issues unrelated to American civil liberties.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pros: the curved shoulder straps are really comfy. Only reason I'm not considering trading up to the larger bag. The added waist strap makes it even more comfy! Probably won't use everyday, but definitely on longer outings. 2/2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new GORUCK bag is in-service. It's definitely smaller than my 511Tactical bag, but I got all my everyday carry stuff in except my Tervus cup. Problem is there NO extra space. Going to have to move some stuff to the outside. 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wanted to make sure Jeanne got her invitation! And that's how a neighborhood in Oregon banded together to find a women they'd never heard of to make sure she got a party invitation. Thank you kind Oregonians! 4/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of them knew Jeanne either, but they set out to find her. Somebody (Paula) hunted online until she found a likely candidate, then e-mailed that information to Alice, who printed it and mailed it back to me with the note. She thought the party sounded really fun and 3/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The invitation had been opened and there was a note inside. Seems Alice doesn't know Jeanne, but she started to check around. She checked with the previous owner of the home, but they didn't know Jeanne either. So she checked with all her neighbors. 2/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny story about nice people I don't know: I've been sending mailed invites to my parents 50th anniversary party. I got an envelope in the mail today from a name I didn't recognize. A lady named Alice. In the envelope was an invitation I mailed to her address, but to Jeanne. 1/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am going to see if 511 will do another warrant replacement on my bag. It still has some good uses, but it's clearly not the right one for everyday carry that includes heavy travel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first 511Tactical COVRT18 bag lasted 9 months. The warranty replacement lasted 3 years and 3 months. I'm upgrading to a GORUCK GR1 with curved straps. It's a little smaller (I think), but totally different design. Hopefully I love it. FingersCrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This case had travelled many times without issue. And I don't care that you opened it. But really, you could avoid this if your employees just put things back the way they found them. They opened my printer box in my case and just chucked the accessories into the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit tsa. You have a responsibility to put my things back in my hard case the way you found them. There's no call whatsoever to unpack my stuff, then not put it back the way you found it. Unless your intent is to destroy things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love 2FA, but I'm setting up a new computer and adding back all of my Slack instances. That's a lot of secret codes . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was so nice to come home to rain! I missed the rain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But your site says you only honor American flights to PR if they have your code-share number. And I can't find any that do. Do you have another partner that flies to PR?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey AlaskaAir , I'm trying to figure out how I can earn miles for a trip to Puerto Rico. Site says via code-shared AA flights, but you don't seem to have any. What's up with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah. This is the most turbulence coming into SEA I can remember in a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to work with somebody who would pop pills in the center. Numerous complaints about it. Nobody cared. I had a trainee once who was clearly hooked on oxy. That one didn't make it. Because I'm mean I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>793<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Common trend I'm seeing in small non-profits: lack of investment in cybersecurity due to lack of understanding. They think a website is a one and done expense, making nobody responsible for patches, updates, security certs. Then they get hacked and don't know what to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grrrrrr AlaskaAir. Detroit is a hot mess. Boarded early. No app notification. No elite lane. Now my bag is behind me somewhere, so I'll have to do the fish swimming upstream thing to retrieve it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a great recap of IAEM 2018! emgtwitter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Edible swag from the iaem leadership meeting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this picture. mdeyerin being the adult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so great! We talk about using games to teach preparedness, but we don't do it enough. No excuses now! iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's one I won't be an early adopter of. Don't want to end up like Captain Archer's prized beagle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was surprised to find out that one of my neighbor EMs passed away earlier this year. IAEM18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty good turnout for this morning's iaem USA business meeting. Starting off with our annual memorial service. IAEM18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sadder thing for me was the why: costs of medical bills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting observation: speaker asked if there were people in the room who weren't yet born when Columbine happened. Hands went up. Much of what we consider part of our shared EM experience isn't. IAEM18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may be my fav takeaway from IAEM18: Lord, grant me the serenity to accept stupid people the way they are, Courage to maintain my self-control, and Wisdom to know that if I act on it, I will go to jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great comments this morning about the importance of getting proper mental healthcare for yourself. Counseling is necessary, not a weakness. IAEM18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huge shout-out to chayne_s (in the photo) and EOC_Designer from the IAEMETC for stepping up to the challenge of recording all the IAEM18 main sessions when the usual guy got deployed! Huge workload they weren't planning on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The moon is lovely though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know we don't have control over this, but whatever the scent is they pump into the air at the AmwayGrandPlaza is killing me. I start wheezing within 10 minutes of being in the building. IAEM18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully not as electrifying as that jolt I took from the podium yesterday during the caucus meeting! IAEM18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure why they call this the sunrise breakfast. The sun isn't up yet and it's 27 degrees! IAEM18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though I'm sure bbdd333 has actual stats . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm probably lower than most years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, there is a prize for most tweets . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should say grads. Oops. Also, first time somebody has publicly called me professor here. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that was one of the largest on-site IAEMETC meetings we've ever had! Good send-off for my last meeting as Chair. IAEM18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So excited that so many of our GeorgetownEDM students and grades are at IAEM18. Nice showing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From audience: machine learning and artificial intelligence are exploding. Some even explains why it made its decision. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Safety requires that we engage, not only with our local, state, and federal elected officials, but with the tech makers as well. They all need to hear from emergency managers. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using all the technologies together in a coordinated reduces milling time since people hear the same info from multiple sources simultaneously. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question: how do we ensure companies are building safety into their tech products? iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Audience question: warning systems require education and training. Need appropriate response from those who receive them. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anything we do with technology is going to both fail and succeed initially. The goal is more successes than failures. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earthquake early warning could also provide automated tsunami warning for those who live close to coast. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Possibility for earthquake early warning: open fire bay doors, self-driving fire engine moves itself out to safety while firefighters are doing "drop, cover, hold". iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Data and automation can push info to your phone when you enter a new area, such as a tsunami zone. Could include evac info. Can also go the other way and tell EM how many people are in the evac area and where they are. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As schuback is talking about home automation and devices, I'm watching a squirrel on my front porch via my camera that has automated notifications. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The majority of our emergency operations should not be using paper anymore. Most of what we do can use databases, electronic forms. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Home automation devices have the ability to tell us now if our homes have power and internet. We can check remotely. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says we've eliminated fax machines. If only that were actually true . . . iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earthquake early warning allows us to use automation to protect things. What if a connected vehicle could move itself out of harm's way prior to the earthquake? iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earthquake early warning is rolling out, but requires more education and training to be successful. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Autonomous vehicles create an attractive target for criminal hackers. We have to be prepared for that. Cybersecurity is critically needed. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uncomfortable laughter in the room when mdeyerin asks how many organizations in the room have ended up with technology bought by somebody who fundamentally didn't understand it. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Autonomous vehicles will bring with them tremendous data. Are we prepared for that? Do we have the knowledge and skills to use it? iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Autonomous vehicles have the ability to create a hyper-effecient system for daily use, but it will have difficulty accounting for surge from unplanned events (like disasters). iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Autonomous vehicles will dramatically change society. Broad adoption will fundamentally change how our world works. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Augmented reality can be particularly useful in recovery, where it can overlay what used to be there with what's there now. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Augmented reality has great uses in EM. Drone footage with road and other data overlaid. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5G requires massive investment in infrastructure. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Autonomous vehicle tech will require 5G and meshed networks to be effective and widely used. They need to talk to each other among other things. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Autonomous vehicles require extensive sensors. Those sensors have to stay clean to work. Can be challenging in a disaster environment. How about ash, fog, heavy snow, or unexpected road closures? iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Logistical needs may be met in the future via autonomous vehicles. Imagine your disaster supplies not having to stop for a sleep break on their way. Or the SNS rolling out on its own as soon as it's needed. iaem18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Driverless cars can provide greater autonomy for people with access and functional needs. iaem18 iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important idea: mapping alternative fuel sites. Critical need for people evacuating in electric cars. iaemetc IAEM18<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here's another vote for native Twitter app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! It's been a fun two years as IAEMETC Chair! I'm certain chayne_s will have as much fun as I did! And maybe he can follow directions better than me and get on the stage when he's supposed to! iaem18 iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 0030 EDT. I'm still up, trying to get this right! But there should be freshly printed whistles at the iaemetc Crisis Technology Center "Tech Petting Zoo" when EMEX opens! iaem18 iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Unstoppable by Sia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. That's perfect. I remember being an Explorer and how exciting it was. It was also a long time ago, so got to do a lot of things that probably aren't allowed anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a one time thing, so I should be ok.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To the contrary, I teach my students to think and learn. They make their own conclusions about the world around them. And many of them are not young.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aren't you required to put a note in when you search my locked bags?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. My pelican arrived in Detroit with the lock popped and damaged. It's not longer usable. No tsa note inside either. Any suggestions AlaskaAir?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The downside of planning a 50th anniversary party for your parents: the ever growing list of their friends and family who are no longer alive. My sister has ended up telling them about most. She just declared she's holding off on any more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yuck. Mad turbulence about 2 hours out. Flight attendants are buckled in. Fun times . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to buy a ticket I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was getting foggy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not just the news. I teach 400 level college courses where students have never been taught how to evaluate sources of any kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The key word there is plan. If I ever have a big one, I'm calling two IMTs immediately. One to do mass care and one to do donations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big plume of ugly smoke near SeaTac airport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and no. In Harvey, where none of the big names were in the rural areas, we needed the non-cash items more than anything. No place to spend cash. Emergent groups managed the donations though. emgtwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, packing for iaem18 feels more like a deployment every year! Come see all the cool tech toys at the iaemetc Crisis Tech Center!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Somebody in Europe has been camping on a domain I want for a couple of years. I've sent multiple offers to buy. They finally responded. They want 6000 EUR for it. Hahahahaha. I don't want it that bad . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. And it prompted a knock on my door at 0730 from somebody who saw what I posted on Nextdoor and recognized the guy from hanging around yesterday. So I met a new neighbor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woke up very early this morning to the sound of all our cameras going off, and this guy on them. I guess he didn't like being lit up by the security lights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I file both complaints and compliments with TSA. They have responded to each and every one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This pretty well sums up my thoughts this week, only with less profanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for me to get home so she can glare at me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I call her Nope Cat because she gives me the nope look about everything (except bonito flakes). Apparently she also gives herself that look. lifewithcats catsoftwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, that was a few years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. And now the bites on my leg are starting to itch . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usually, yes. Tonight was bad. It's also the only place a TSA agent has felt compelled to tell me god didn't approve of my tattoos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We do that to people. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Human?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, we won't be home for another ~5 hours. Though sometimes these planes feel like home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right? I usually sit on the other side of the plane. Glad I switched it up this time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice view of the Pentagon at sunset on the way out! Thanks for taking me home AlaskaAir! iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG TSA at DCA sucked tonight. Pre-check closed early (by my watch) so we all had to do the great bag unpack in line. And then the agent pulled every bag and device for extra screening. My surface pen was suspicious, as was my bag of tea bags. Security theater at its finest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rennaisance Not my first stay there. They handled this well, so probably not my last either. But yeesh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woke up in my fancy DC hotel this morning with bug bites on my legs. And a water leak. They are handling it appropriately, but so gross.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here's a story that illustrates why I volunteer for SKCClinic every year. I met a hard working lady who is experiencing homelessness. Not only was she able to the glasses she needed, she got to connect with resources that might solve her housing issue (and still get to her job).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It turns out that after 4 days of doing line management, I have zero patience for people in the pre-check line who can't follow basic instructions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not a gif, but it will do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very full pdxwinterhawks box. And the SeattleTbirds are winning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The SKCClinic is my favorite event all year. Somewhere around 1000 people get care each day for 4 days. This is my typical day, leading the team that gets people in the front door. They do awesome work! LateToBed EarlyToRise<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Opening night of hockey season. First beer calamity before the puck even dropped. Rando lady behind me sat down and put her bottle of water into the full beer cup of the season ticket holder next to her. First beervalanche of the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess that's a matter of perspective. Novel solutions to unique problems have to innovate in real time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>0330 will be here far too soon, but I'm not sleepy! Tomorrow starts day one of SKCClinic. If you know anyone in Seattle area who could use free healthcare, share the info with them. Now though Sunday. Link on tagged page.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a two layer case from Seido. Pulled it apart, put the disk inside. People think it's sorcery when I slap my phone on the mag mount and it sticks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If that's they want. Many people go for dental and vision care. Check out the website linked in their profile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, the only requirement to receive services is to show up. Tell people you know! And show up yourself if you need something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite event of the year starts tomorrow (for me at least). It's time for the SKCClinic! Final day of setup tomorrow, patients start coming in the front door at 0630 Thursday. 1000 people a day will get free healthcare with no strings attached. Volunteer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: I should probably include a coupon for Depends with this email because people are going to poop their pants. infosec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I give that advice all the time. It never occurred to me to apply it in this situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is kind of funny. There are several of us on this AlaskaAir flight to Seattle who were on the super delayed flight here on Sunday. We have a shared misery that we're acknowledging with nods and knowing looks. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a her!!! I wanted to say "I'm a serial stabber" but it would have been a lie since she would have been my first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure I couldn't disagree with this more. Innovation gets us through so many disasters. "We've always done it this way" isn't a great way to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attacked by a serial hugger today, who literally said "I'm a hugger, get over it".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interestingly, in that situation, I didn't do it intentionally. I just hit a nerve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you force someone to confront their own bias, things can get weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had an EM guy get so mad when I sincerely asked "how does that work for your community" he threw a pencil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I pick my battles carefully most of the time. Some people just never think about it and when you do, they learn. Others, well, I might as well tell my cat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, and somewhat unrelated, is this the Dave Neal I went to APCO in Nashville with in 2002? Who may have accidentally or otherwise prodded me to teach as a hobby? If so, thanks for that encouragement. It worked out well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You gotta do you it because you love it! Enthusiasm comes and goes. I think optimism gets tempered by reality. But I remain optimistic because I've seen real change for the better during my career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of our work is discounted, if it's even acknowledged at all. Also, I may be old and grumpy. GetOffMyLawn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I literally had one say yesterday that because he, with a job, and normal life, easily evacuated, it should be easy for everybody else. I said something about privilege, he countered with his days in civil defense, and I moved along to something more productive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I specifically meant I'm tired of EMs saying people refused to evacuate when it's simply not true in many cases. When an EM refuses to acknowledge all the complex social factors that go into the decision, the don't deserve the job anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blergh. Social services, not studies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other thing that happens is that women in abusive relationships have an opportunity to report and get away. They may not have had access to social studies until the disaster happens and now differently they do. Cc: SamLMontano<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can get the second one online in PDF format for free. I'll have to dig around to see where. It's expensive because it's out of print.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was going to be my dissertation topic. It's such an important topic. Communities are usually unprepared for the increase in reporting and need for additional services.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If they do the safety brief a second time, I'm gonna cry . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New ETA Austin: 0145. Two hours late. Ugh . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite literal interpretation though is this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, we're not yet. People still boarding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paperwork done. Searching for passengers who left to get food. About to finally get this AlaskaAir flight off the ground. I hope. iflyalaska (except for when we're sitting on the tarmac).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure that's the only thing I'll inherit when my folks die. A knitting machine . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You asked for proof. I pointed you to it. If you want to argue, argue with one of the idiots on YouTube who had co-opted OK. Tell him he is not proof. And yes, they're mostly him . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plane is fixed. Now the paperwork has to get done. New ETA for departure approx 1935. Almost two hours late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm tired and hungry. I have work I was planning to do. I suppose I'll have to pay extra to get to my hotel tonight since the shuttle ends at 11:30 and the rental company closes at 1AM. And this flight status is still "on time".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Serial huggers are not cool. If I say I don't want a hug, don't do it anyway. So many times . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mechanic on board finally. People being allowed off plane to get food or whatever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a duvet and duvet cover! The cover is necessary to protect it from the cats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is a lie. We never departed and we're back at a gate. Ugh AlaskaAir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You asked for proof, not news. Proof is people actually doing it and saying why they're doing it. They're on YouTube. And the world is not better for it. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sending via DM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check the YouTube.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably, but I can't tell from the app<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Noooooooooooooooo! After sitting on the tarmac for 30 minutes, this AlaskaAir plane is going back to the gate for mechanical. There's no way I get my car picked up before hertz in Austin closes at 1 AM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. Any other airline I've flown that has bulkheads saves space for those people to at least put something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is it that I'm like the 12th person to get on this AlaskaAir plane and all the bin space within two rows is full? No space saved for bulkhead, and it's an Airbus, so there is an actual bulkhead. NotCool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can go over their heads, but I want to give them a chance to fix it. Though they can't unroll what's already happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm 98% certain I know where the data breach occurred that allowed this to happen. Notifed them. They don't want to talk to me, nor do they seem to understand that this whole thing is due to their negligence. They seem uninterested in fixing the issue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OMG. One of my non-profits got phished, by somebody using my name. And sent some rando 1/3 of their bank account. They're calling the bank to stop the payments and I guess I'll be doing some forensics when I land. I may also vomit in the interim.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's a good thought exercise though for the rest of us to consider. It's looking like this one was human error (at least initial report), but it's reasonable to think about the what-ifs. Especially in my primary field (emergency management) where we almost never consider cyber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey EMGTwitter, currentish research on emergency personnel willing/able to report for duty in disasters? Not finding much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The general rule is "if you see it, smell it, hear it" in places it shouldn't be during a disaster, turn it off. Our CERT teams are taught this in earthquake country, for their own homes and neighborhoods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the gas provider says don't do it, you don't. They're the experts. If you do it wrong, you BOOM. And once it's off, only the gas provider can turn it back on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's not a false agenda. Routine spending includes training. Training is required for effective response.

<|startoftext|>The problem is getting there. I was hoping for SODO because both train and light rail make easy access. There is no easy access to Seattle Center from the south end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not likely to deploy this year, but I did just invest in a really great portable power kit. Replicated the ihackcharities kit:<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Smoking a cigar while I have this cough is probably the least smart thing I did today. It was tasty though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the PeTreaTFeeder wifi cat food dish finally got hacked yesterday, which was more or less expected (and why it lived a somewhat solitary life on our internet of shit network). Vendor seems to have no security fix and maybe no idea of what to do at all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ugh. A light blanket of smoke has been to settle over the Gorge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks more like some sort of weird blessing . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey ihackcharities, somebody at your Defcon booth said you had those awesome carry-on power kits available to purchase via a link on your website. Not finding it. Are they available anywhere, pre-made?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never doubted that he put country before self. And that is the most important thing those who serve, be it in the military or in Congress, can do. Hell, it's the most important thing any of us can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's merit to that. My sister is a tankerman. Before that, she was a longshoreman. That's the job title. It can get awkward though. It would be more awkward to retire it tankerperson though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OMG. The tent next to us has a mouse in it. There are four college kids in that tent. This is hilarious. Nobody is getting any sleep for a while. camping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also a huge number of dangerous choke points getting out. Their management was equally absent. It was the stuff that MCIs are made of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So LiveNation seems to have given up on any semblance of actual security at The Gorge. Not only ignoring people who set off the metal detectors, but doing zero ticket/seat enforcement. Aisle was 3-deep (supposed to be 1) and nobody even checked on it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what I thought about gin, until I discovered they also make it from other things. Now I love non-pine tree gin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This could be a long flight. There's a doggo doing a lot of barking in the cargo hold, seemingly right under me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my new favorite quote of all time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope they don't. My reaction to other airlines ranges from "meh" to "I'd rather die".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a shitshow of a day with them a couple of weeks ago, but that doesn't erase all the really great days. I can't imagine switching to anybody else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a disaster nerd, please give a hand with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody said this to me today! I gave them the dog look, so they amended to say it will slow the lava down. Uhhhhhh, no. Really, just no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh Marriott. This MarriottRewards merger has been a debacle. Haven't been able to login now for two days . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's me almost every time I travel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a great cause!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A non tech con I attend includes personal attendee info in a QR code on their badge. The tech subgroup complained and was met with "meh". So we printed stickers with new QR codes that rickrolled everybody who scanned them. An imperfect but briefly satisfying solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. There were plenty of opportunities to prevent this. When we would deploy, we always made sure the sat phone company knew and was ready and that Verizon knew and moved us to whatever plan we needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's significant to me if that whoever signed the contract clearly didn't understand the use case. Could Verizon have handled it differently? Sure. Could whoever was in charge of ordering the service have gotten the right plan to begin with? Definitely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This +. Having had a super creepo encounter at a con, it was great to realize that the people around me (men and women) had my back. I was able to tell him to bugger off, but I really only think he did because the posse left him outnumbered.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's called Clear . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then she got her third bad searched and was trying to "help". I'm so baffled with people end up in that line and have no idea what's going on . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this one had the whole line tell her to put her stuff back and still asked the TSA agent. And this line is already basically not moving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seriously hate being in the pre-check line with people who don't understand it and are taking all their crap out of their bags.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Registries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ranted about this in front of a room of people this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In his roll as booth cat:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We might have to wait for his ear to heal up. He looks a little sketchy right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His real names is Butters and he's at ButtersOK. He used to be the official disaster cat when I was a City EM. He'd be up for it. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's almost exactly it. Sometimes it's language, sometimes it's concepts, sometimes it's just that nerds are alien beings from another planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn't say refuse. I would say can't. At least in the form it's being presented. I hear refuse a lot, but usually from people for whom the problem is obvious and glaring. And they get frustrated in trying to communicate it and take it as refusal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, in general, communicating tech info to a non-tech audience is fraught with peril. It's easy to talk over the level of the audience OR treat them like they're stupid. Finding the sweet spot in the middle can be hard, especially for someone who isn't a trained communicator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have many thoughts on this. One of the classes I teach is on risk perception and risk communication. And then I actually do those things in real life. Part of the issue is that people don't receive that THEY have risk and until they do, communication will prob fail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My usual quote is "until the AI says FU" but that didn't make it in for some reason!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe we could have you talk about the tech, in a somewhat vendor agnostic way, at an upcoming IAEMETC meeting. Cc: EOC_Designer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is both a blessing and a curse. With all the work we do telling people not to say stuff they're supposed to keep private, we're clearly failing . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I miss mine too! Luckily, the King Ranch goats are only a mile from me. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My tracker died a horrible death in the ocean right before defcon. My new one was waiting for me when I got home. I'm sad to have missed out on all the step tracking goodness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grrrrrr. Crater, not career.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This isn't your fault. You can't report what you don't know. As someone who booked a room prior to the policy change, CaesarsPalace NEVER updated me with their new terms. They never e-mailed to say things changed, and they sure as hell didn't disclose it when I checked in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Got home from defcon and discovered that ButtersOK had an abscess on his ear that burst. Hubby enroute to vet with him, because I have a conference call.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hell, a name and a decent approximation of age can get you a treasure trove.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last year on a trip, some guy behind me bought tractor parts via phone. Name, addresses, credit card info. Half the plane could hear him. And I'm sure when his credit card was compromised, he truly had no idea how . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a plane. Leaving defcon. Dude just gave his name, dob, and last 4 of SSN to someone on the phone, in order to cancel a medical appointment. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first defcon was DC4. It has really changed, mostly for the better. Definitely better representation of women and minorites. Definitely better code of conduct (aka there is one). thedarktangent's initiative to encourage reporting and provide transparency are on point too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the airport after defcon. Where you expect your bags to get flagged for "something". Guy in front of me had business cards that looked "sharp" via x-ray. Weird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what are the dates for defcon 27? defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's more to the bio hack village than medical! Last year they were putting RFID chips in people. There's a good chunk of people in that space who are their own walking experiments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean like the bio hacking village?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So people sitting in the back of defcon closing session can't hear what's being said on the mic. defcon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why are we spending so much money protecting white supremacists? Seriously, why do they deserve more protection than the people they hate? Free speech has consequences and maybe these assholes should face those consequences instead of being shielded.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Long shot, but if anybody knows the guy who was at defcon Juno Reactor tonight, front of stage, had the mic handed to him, I have his picture. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stoked to see JunoReactor at defcon in a few!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gross. Some bonehead smoking in hackerkaraoke. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have chips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome! Niki7a on the hackerkaraoke stage now. And nobody ever rocked Big Balls more. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have learned that my EthicsVillage talk had a line and was one in/one out. That makes me uncharacteristically happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonus: $5 drinks in here tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And bonus, hackerkaraoke drinks are only $5. defcon hackerkaraoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slightly late a start, but hackerkaraoke is off and running. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don't give out awards. Not ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the kind of stuff I want to talk to noahreiter about. Language processing should be at the point where somebody can get this right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a team now?? Woohoo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could hear my mom make "that face" because I used a bad word. Then we had our usual talk about why they should activate the LastPass accounts I sent them. And I reminded her to make sure antivirus was up to date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missed my chance at a wisporg sticker. Again. If you have one, I'll trade for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: what did dad do? Mom: what? Me: I know he clicks on crazy old man shit served up by Russian bots, so what did he click this time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Text from Dad: please call Mom. Something is wrong with the computer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for coming!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was great! One empty seat and everybody stayed until they had to start getting in line for the next thing on their list. And a bunch of people asked questions. Great questions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most important though, created something innovative that has the potential to be improved and and used to save lives in the future. 2/2 EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The question that surprised me at my defcon EthicsVillage talk: what did I think about elonmusk and his offer to help with the Thai cave rescue? I liked it. Created a thing that might be needed, delivered it, accepted "no" for an answer. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not 1355m0r3 handing out business cards is it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Positive thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things that make defcon special!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Per noahreiter, Rave does this already. Going to chat soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice gif btw. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta duck out of hackerkaraoke early because I have to, like, adult in the morning. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ewwwwwwwwwww<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the saddest transcript you'll ever read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a thing I know from being a 911 dispatcher. Hopefully the FAA gives that person good support. You always end up wondering if you should have said something different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to argue against his own words though. And there is an ID on him per Pierce County. They just haven't announced the name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. hackerkaraoke 10th anniversary swag! defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That whole island could go with it so dry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure it does, but they've got great zoom on those cameras. We used them for an interface fire once until KCSO helo could get there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw talk somewhere of getting a firefighting helo in, but I'm not sure who has one locally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is also a very interesting case in rumor control. Official word of any kind was very slow, and with ATC open for listening, it was all out there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, she's with the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insider threats are always the hardest, anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone who spends a lot of time at this airport, I have so many questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yeah, hackerkaraoke is lit tonight. Some actual hardcore talent in here! defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new favorite defcon swag! hackerkaraoke rocks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'll skip the bananas tomorrow . . . defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My EthicsVillage presentation is finished, with 16 hours to spare. Some of which (at least 3) I need to spend sleeping. Or so I've heard . . . defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny that I mentioned you by name in a meeting the other day and said we should loop you in. We need to talk soon, before the wheel gets reinvented (by one of your existing customers!)..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need an opt-in alert system for emergencies that will automatically translate (correctly) to the receiver's opted-in language. Will ravemsafety, Everbridge, OnSolve or somebody else will be first? Guaranteed EMGTwitter market for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They come in button and magnet form too! From Stickerum. Order yours today! safetythird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm familiar with this feeling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The NordVPN Android client is the biggest battery hog ever . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which of you idiots set off the fire alarm? defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best way is to find Stickerum. Somewhere in the defcon horde.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bedside lamp in my hotel room just turned itself on, then back off again. Nobody is near it. I'm not sure what to think of this. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gave my last safetythird sticker to some guy wearing a safetysecond shirt last night. These just appeared via courier. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So in the mess of yesterday, AlaskaAir somehow ended up booking my hubby two seats under two reservations for our return. I noticed this and called them to cancel one of them. They want $125 to cancel the extra seat. So we're keeping both, which I'm sure will lead to chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it always a guy with a tractor??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get the impression you've not actually visited local governments to see their practices. These are the same places that get cryptolockered because they can't get people to quit clicking on stupid shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now we're officially later than our original flight. Luckily it's only going to make me late for a party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally at LAS and we're going to have a 15 minute wait for a gate. So we're arriving at the same time we would have for our cancelled flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's annoying. twitter now requires that you give them a name of who is being impersonated when you report an account for that. That's how I've been reporting bots. I just wrote in that it was a bot impersonating a human.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it turns out my reservation home wasn't cancelled, but because I got upgraded and hubby didn't, they split me off into a new reservation. Which means of course that since I don't have a companion anymore, my companion can't be upgraded. To this, I say meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I hit the "everything that can go wrong did" day. I guess it's fair since things usually go so well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhh. This is not good. Somehow, even though I'm on this plane, AlaskaAir dropped me from the reservation and seems to have cancelled my return flight. We've got a few days to sort this out, but it can't be good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last minute upgrade. Gave it to hubby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, all kinds of weird stuff. Good luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: hey, there's a helicopter hovering right there [at the airport]. That's wierd. Gate agent: not really. It's been an "interesting" day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also a bunch of unaccompanied minors. What an odd mix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some other flight is delayed due to a shortage of fuel trucks at SEA. I've never heard that before!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This flight is full of excited nerds going to hacker summer camp and old people confused by the nerds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cancelled flight, now a delay. And this flight is oversold due to the cancelled one. Bad travel day for AlaskaAir. iFlyAlaska anyway because they deal with this stuff with kindness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it turns out I DO have something for you. Hubby grabbed everything in the vicinity and the item was in the pile!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not an issue today since this flight is packed, but it's been over a year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had this argument. I think I once said "quit being an ass and let me opt out".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After all the chaos of my cancelled flight and hubby having to bring all my stuff to the airport, looks like the only thing I'm missing is my Surface case, which has my Surface pen and favorite thumbdrive in it. Not bad at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey AlaskaAir I see you still have the bug in your system where my companion doesn't get added to the upgrade list. Any ETA to fix that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might but have a thing for you now. Except a hug!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>String of profanity laden texts to my husband telling him which of my stuff to grab so he can meet me at the airport. headache<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time ever, AlaskaAir cancelled my flight. Got on an earlier one, sans my first class upgrades. Mad scramble to rearrange my day to get there though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have something for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know! I'm going to go OD on Emergen-C and go to bed early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm losing the battle against this cold. This is soooooo not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I packed all my stuff for defcon in a backpack and a carry-on. Makes me think I'm probably forgetting something really important ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love stuff like this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was ihackedwhat in your room??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As of 0330, I have a cold. How do I end up with a cold in the middle of summer, and just in time for hacker summer camp?? Grrrrrr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have one, but won't be there til tomorrow night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess the real reason I got an ArloSmartHome camera system was to see what my cat did when he escaped last night ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suspect I would be unhappy with the 10" screen. I have LOVED my Pro 3 for deployments (and everything else I do). I even find it lacking screen real estate sometimes though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I'm jealous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The little buggers are so friendly sometimes too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to get out of the car, but Wheezer's cover of Africa just came on, so I'm stuck here for a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You status matched me and I moved all my reservations over already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just pandemonium down there. Flights are not getting put on the carousel sign. Handlers are telling people they can't stand on one side of the carousel, then letting other people stand there. Thought a fight was going to break out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh AlaskaAir . Your baggage people at SEA are overly grumpy tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such floof!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11 AM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love seeing one of my all-time favorite nerds as excited about a thing as I am. Makes it like triple exciting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theoretically, yes. At this point, inspired by airplane gin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a pretty spectacular airplane sunset. Thanks AlaskaAir! IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One week from today, I'll be talking about the Ethics of Technology in Humanitarian and Disaster Response at the defcon EthicsVillage. See you there! defcon ethicsvillage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that's in Auburn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand that feeling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry you had a shitty afternoon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depended on the incident. They had assets to bring to the table for most anything transportation related and we shared a common interest in getting transpo routes open quickly. Chamber was more recovery usually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. Look at the fancy new AlaskaAir blankies! Quilted! I kind of want one for home. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. Sitting at FLL waiting for our AlaskaAir flight. Counter staff have an unaccompanied minor who nobody came to get. Phone conversation happened and clearly somebody is either running late or didn't understand that they had to come through security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any of them. We had chamber of commerce, hospital, a very large aerospace company, a large grocery store chain, all with seats in our city EOC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha! That does add a new level of complexity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do make it overly complicated. One of my in-door speakers is now secured with zip ties because the overly complicated part broke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're horrible. I ended up helping them once on my own car because they were soooooo slow. We just do our own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why, WHY do people have speakerphone conversations in public?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we're about to embark on the special hell that is COBRA next month. Can't wait . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have had the most ridiculous conversations with pharmacies. My doc wrote my a scrip for 12 of my precious migraine pills. Neither she or I knew the limit was 10, and through multiple escalations, nobody ever said that. Just NO. Easy fix, once the problem was clear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Global Entry FTW. Miami cruise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sounded like a job for chayne_s. Got reasons. Or maybe for Alisha_Beth or ElizabethKingEM, in preparation for their upcoming goat ownership.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear Misfit, Ray no like salt water. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Greetings from Grand Cayman Stickerum! sunsafety safetythird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I didn't know better, I'd think I was already at defcon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone who has a lot of active duty and retired Army in my classes, I agree with this more than you'll ever know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never had anything I lost on a plane returned to me by any airline. I think there's a troll that just eats everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully this is my last avis fail. Once again, they changed my reservation without my permission and gave me airline miles instead of points. Hello Hertz!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My NordVPN client on Android has become a huge battery hog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Puget Sound ends up socked in by smoke at least once every summer due to smoke. It gets really gross. And luckily, for St. Helens, we were south, so though we had ashfall, it wasn't nearly as bad as NE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn you Russia!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: there are two snails, a dark one and a light one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We also watched a snail make its way all the way across the patio. We know how to party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Saturday night on vacation: sitting on the patio drinking rum, watching little lizards hunt moths. The moths are losing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So does Hertz status match avis? I think it might be time for a change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I pay avis for the gas option and they give me a car with 1/4 tank of gas. So now somebody is taking it to fill it up and they'll be back. Eventually. We should have almost been to our room by now. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's way too early in the morning for avis shananigans, but here we are. Walk all the way out to Preferred counter at MCO and it's closed. Back inside, big line, one agent. TryHarder fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhh. I know a couple of other people who got it the same way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking of airline drinks . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did you get verified?? I get rejected every time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will drink rum out of a sippy cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And rum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! We'll be ok, but it's unnerving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The spousal unit got laid off this week, so I'm gonna go with no.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seattle Emergency Management job, as Emergency Planning Coordinator. Big shoes to fill! EMGTwitterEMJobsEMLife<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can't get logged in to the app isn't either my SSO or my app password. Keeps telling me I need to connect, I click the connect button, and nothing new happens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like this is a thing that defcon needs. defcon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm really excited to be speaking at the defcon EthicsVillage about the ethics of technology in humanitarian and disaster response. A topic near and dear to my heart. EMGTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were shipped the hard copy of the most recent, but the logs people shipped the wrong stuff to the site (we're off campus). We got it all fixed though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>But people don't store the notebook at home. They pack it back and forth to with them since it has they password they've ever made . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS, no, your notebook of handwritten passwords is NOT safer than an encrypted password manager. Similarly, using the same password everywhere with the name of the site appended is also dumb. FFSTechConf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Children, teach your parents well. Otherwise they will post hateful memes they don't understand on Facebook and will be confused with everyone yells at them. adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a con that may well be worth traveling for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's kind of sad that on many of my trips, my backpack is heavier than my suitcase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's always a right answer, but that answer is going to vary depending on who makes it. The thing with ethical decisions is that you can always pick out the one that most closely fits your values. Others will make you second guess though because it doesn't fit their values.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not without violating FERPA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is fascinating. Why is it so hard for twitter to get a handle on this and shut the bots down??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of these was an impeccably written paper. It checked clean against the plagiarism database, but it had not one single reference in it. Had it had references, it would have been the top paper in the class. It also had no cover page or name, but that's a whole different issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>APA. But I'd take any attempt for partial credit ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I didn't know I had to cite my sources" is an invalid excuse in my classes 100% of the time. And my inbox is about to explode with people sending that comment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, if we were in the boonies, I wouldn't care. We're in suburbia though, where one man's rocket is another man's house fire. Though we did get buckets of rain yesterday ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really over the fireworks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of use in disaster and humanitarian work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fill mine with hotel toiletries, then take them to the food bank and the homeless day center.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not sure which is more weird. The bolt cutters or the bareness . . . bestofnextdoor nextdoor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Website versioning. Sometimes I wish that the internet would in fact forgot things . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or to could call it the easy to read version, since it's pretty well a national best practice for public education material. More pictographs, fewer words. Saves lives sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not suggesting the criteria is different, but people's ability to understand it is. And candidly, so I'd what we expect them to do. Wilderness probably has no 911 to call!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having done both wilderness and street medicine, there's a decided difference in how you approach the two. There's also a very different audience for the two. This second flyer would be great for practitioners who understand what "standard of care" means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sort of defeats the purpose!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So excited for defcon ethicsvillage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public educators know we target 4th grade language skills. It helps account not just for education, but also for LEP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That seems to have too many big words for our typical audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have the original. I just did a quick screen grab of what he posted because I was too lazy to hunt for the original.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And now I'm stuck in Navient phone tree hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just perfect. Since Navient can't get their act together on my auto-pay, I have to pay manually. And they misapplied my payment and show one of my loans overdue. Damned scammers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parental tech support is the very, very hardest ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But do people discard their deepest values? If the value is easily discarded, it probably wasn't one of your actual core values. People can usually list off a bunch of "things" they value, but those in and of themselves aren't values. They're still just things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's also important to recognize that some people WILL choose to walk away, knowing they can no longer put food on the table. That's the thing with values: we all have different ones and we will act according to what is most important to us. You can't force others to share yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says that's how long it takes my bank to confirm, which is bull, since they confirmed the DOE ones in 48 hours. This is Navient's way of getting every single penny from people that they can. 2/2 StudentLoans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a bigger scam than Navient? Changed bank accounts a month a ago. DOE loans serviced by Navient switched in two days. Navient loans, serviced by Navient, still haven't switched. Have to pay higher interest for no auto-pay until they switch. 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha. He needed to get his bag, which was wedged in by mine. I moved mine, he got his bag. I put mine in it's rightful place, this blocking his bag. Instead of putting it under his seat, it's behind his legs now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! And he's clearly a frequent flyer, so he should know better. Or he just does this . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's a really good reason that student chapters have advisors. Student region probably should have as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I like the idea of having them part of their geo regions and then having a caucus. But with no students, it will be a moot point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. The point of the emails is to ask them to withdraw it so we don't even have to vote on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's another headed to Colorado now, with a ski patroller. That could be epic!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>During the Okanogan Complex Fire in 2015, they thought they might have to evac the EOC 3 different times. Not a full pause in ops, but certainly a diversion of some resources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for the record, my student chapter at GeorgetownEDM WILL dissolve since all of my students are graduate students who will no longer be eligible for student membership. No student members = no student chapter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This honestly makes me rethink my membership in iaem. It seems mean-spirited and contrary to the goals and mission of the organization and seems to violate our own code of ethics. I hope all members will reach out to leadership AND vote against this if it's not withdrawn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9 days ago I tweeted this and sent a letter to iaem leadership asking questions and asking that they withdraw the proposal. They have not responded. I've since learned that of the 750 student members, approximately 90% would no longer be eligible and would not convert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So SlackHQ is taking a siesta again today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interestingly, while there are creepy people everywhere, I've found the best anti-creepy people at defcon. i.e. when I had somebody being creepy and annoying, there were way more people willing to have my back without me asking than I've found at some other places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they threw in a generator test for kicks. And maybe the generator was overloaded? It was surging, so we had the disco ball thing going on for half an hour or so, followed by the strobes of the fire alarm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Was sad about being first on the upgrade list and it being full. Until I saw somebody up there wearing a surgical mask. I'm all good back here . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the second delay was an un-delay. We just picked up 10 minutes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll add it to my list of things to do next time I'm there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I'm getting donuts in Portland, it will be at VoodooDoughnut!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annddd there's the first delay. Going to make up time though, so hopefully I still make my connection. I love Portland, but I don't want to spend the night there tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at that temperature gradient!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've sat on the tarmac here before. In the dark. In a huge thunderstorm. Great pics somewhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I'm put together today. I got two compliments on my shoes and one on my watch. And I heard through the lunchroom grapevine that people liked my talk. I guess that's a good day! EMLife adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. That's why I was asking! Can't figure out how we get an online departure with no airplane. Maybe they have one stashed somewhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They actually usually relieve pressure, lessening the chances of a big one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing we're going to have a delay on 771 since I don't see any inbounds scheduled to get here before we're supposed to board. Any idea?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was same as always. I was there for 4 hours. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I drove in from EMI. Creepy clouds with fingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No joke! Though there are a lot of delays building here at DCA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In and out in 24 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This cell is right on the airport. I think there was a strike in Crystal City. Certainly a deafening crack.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. Very much yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Gogo is not helping me get stuff done today. Soooooo slowwwwwe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the first time I've flown first class on an AlaskaAir A320. Fancier than the 737, but also inconvenient. Having no under seat storage throws my game off! IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now if you can just make our Lounge membership work at the SFO Admiral's club. Having to leave security to get to the Cathay Pacific club doesn't really work. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm a big fan of these embraer 175 planes that AlaskaAir uses. The window is the perfect height to actually look out of. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As we were boarding, there was a lady at the next AlaskaAir gate over, losing her mind because they had closed boarding for her flight. She was blaming them for not announcing the flight (she was wrong). But really, if you have a ticket, the time is on it. It's your job to read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure he wins the Internet every day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. The last leg of our journey today is being delayed due to a missing flight attendant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice shout out from the AlaskaAir crew on this flight to all the new USArmy combat medics headed to JBLM! Lots of cheers and applause from the passengers. iflyalaska<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A spork. Though having now seen this spork, my current one seems inferior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My hams looked at me and said "it's just message traffic".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. Not scba.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, the endless loop of reaching out and never actually connecting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its performance was mildly improved by adding the associated apps and connecting them to DTVNow. I've also noticed that I can sometimes view things via the mobile app that I can't via the FireTV app. It's been frustrating, but not enough for me to drop it yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Somebody called and left a message. I called back. It told me to press # to leave a message. No matter how many times a pressed it, nothing ever happened and it finally hung up on me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not a great work at home day. Now there are 6 gas company rigs outside, their phones ringing non-stop, radios talking, there's a concrete saw making a HUGE amount of noise, conversations everywhere. I me with the windows open because there's still a faint gas odor in here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And bonus: since I don't have natural gas service, I'm good to go. Entire rest of the neighborhood has to go through the whole start-up process once they fix the line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy with the gas wand just came and made sure my house wasn't going to explode. Had already started ventilating, but it was probably ok anyway. Just had the lovely oderizer smell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, and as I come in the house ButtersOK crawls lazily out from under the bed, wondering if maybe he missed something ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And kudos to ValleyFire and PSETalk for being right on this. From the time the firefighter pounded on my door until the time I was back home was only about half an hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I'm walking up to my front door, I hear contractor boss say to contractor dude: I'd like to you do something right for once. With the gas company employees all standing there listening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fire truck is leaving. I think that's my cue to go home .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. Just had to evacuate because bonehead contractors across the street hit a gas main. Had to leave the cats because they wouldn't be found. On foot, because starting the truck was not allowed. EMGTwitter EMLife<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This one is actively soliciting test takers to submit their tests. It also has a Twitter account, but I'm not going to give it any attention ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one thus far seems nearly 100%. I haven't found a wrong answer yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a guy doing a structural evaluation on my house right now. He's been talking to himself for the past hour. It's both amusing and annoying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As the bridge, we have some responsibility for this I think. 15 pages of polysyllabic words and stats isn't relatable for someone who maybe only graduated high school.

<|startoftext|>Agreed. I floated a proposal when I was chairing the IAEM Theory to Practice committee to include an article about an academic paper in every Bulletin issue. It died in committee. Maybe we need to create a theory to practice blog where we do this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is possibly the funniest phishing message I've ever gotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way back in 1996, the now spouse and I drove from Oregon to Vegas via San Jose for defcon. We recalled the other day that we had a passenger, who had driven from Washington to hitch a ride and contribute gas money. We have no recollection of his name though. Was it you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's one way to get out of it . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sorry. You can borrow my dad if you need a new one. He mostly talks about his chickens and his garden. And he's legit happy for me when something good happens. And he's never been averse to adding new random family members. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, 2FA FTW! Best way to maintain security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not my usual kind of job post, but the City of Auburn is looking for a Network Engineer. Great team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy across the street from us is mowing his overgrown, uneven yard with an old school, non-powered push mower. Admire his commitment. Appreciate the hilarity. We provided our own commentary while we ate dinner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is horrible, but it's also more than two years old. Not exactly breaking news.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My dad needs this. He's sure Snopes is not legit because he read it on the internet. So he sends me things to fact check. And I use Snopes . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But kudos to both avis and AlaskaAir for making their issues right and to TSA for acknowledging I was cranky about their operation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get that. You clearly need more staffing at Nashville. There were 5 wheelchairs waiting for screening, one medical device, 2 strollers, and me. And we just kept on waiting . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would have been a perfect series for a Twitter thread. I just didn't expect to have a cascade failure to report . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Actually, there was a cherry on top of the icing on the cake. I broke a nail. And in some sort of poetic moment, it was that nail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the icing on the cake, pulled for extra TSA screening. Opted out of the mystery machine. Waited 15 minutes for them to find a woman to pat me down. And then they decided my shoes needed an extra screening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've seen more! But that was before the kinder, gentler days of TheWHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It makes far more sense in print.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second intermission. And we're a little fuzzy on the penalties. They announced ones that aren't real! Waiting for the game sheet to update.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5 were on the ice. Missing either in the box or in the locker room. Lots of big penalties with 3 left in the period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two minutes for fighting?! Someone needs to explain this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It started at somebody saying "I wish we had cake". Then "hey, I wonder if UberEats has cake'. And then there was cake. And now I want cake damnit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We did that for a game night a few weeks ago. It was amazing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like they finally pulled a rabbit out of their hat and fixed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It happened in Anchorage. It was clearly not my phone since it's fine here. It worked for two days there and then would not give data access. You might want to look into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good news is that my data is working fine now that I'm back home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very specific criteria have to be met in order for Amber Alert to be issued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Contract complete, but there's nobody in the fed government to process my invoice. And my investments lost as much today as I contributed all of last year. 2018 is not off to a good start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to take up curling so I can be an Olympian. It's never too late!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember moving to a new facility. I worked from a neighbor agency for "a few hours". After 13, they sent relief . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A) how did that work out?? B) can you convince somebody down there to let me teach??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My projectfi phone has quit connecting to data on a trip. Called support. Pushed many buttons. Reboot. Took long. Support tech left vm in interim. He assumes everything is working since I didn't answer. Um, no. fail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No, that's right off shore from the airport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! It was a beautiful flight in. I got this one of the ice. It looks like lichens to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't matter how many times I've been here, I'm always blown away by the stunning beauty of Alaska..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Drunk Russian very nearly fell over the back of my seat. At least he apologized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He also spilled his beer, but did not hurt anyone or anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now drunk Russian is annoying. Started badgering polite lady as soon as her boyfriend left his seat. Kerfuffle behind box brought supervisors and cops to our area tho and he chilled a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out the Russian is pretty drunk. He's also full and trying to convince the girl next to him to eat the other half of his sandwich. She's being very polite. An leaning closer and closer to her boyfriend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our usher retired. His name was Larry and we really liked him He's now season ticket holder in our section. Our new usher is much younger and we look forward to many seasons with him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seat neighbor and I had already exchanged the "are we gonna have to call an usher" look before we figured out what was up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny thing. When he first got here, I thought maybe he was a misplaced soccer fan. Talking to himself. Then I figured out he had a buddy behind him, who he was talking to, in another actual language.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're probably a little tame by comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russian guy is pretty funny. Clearly had no idea WTF we're all doing with our clapping and chanting and whatnot, but he's got his own. Which is mostly yelling AYE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy behind me is yelling in Russian. Clearly a hockey fan. Just said the first words I've heard in English "Number 2 is very good". And then Stand got the assist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watched it explode as a kid. Now I'm an emergency manager with a tattoo of on her back!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pet peeve: if you're going to call your donut an apple fritter, it better have at least one piece of apple in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sounded like they were going to land on my house for a minute there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sort of dislike you right now! We were inagural season ticket holders there and this was so memorable, for all the wrong reasons!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For davematthewsbnd fans, this is big news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My parents used to live in the boonies and feed their assortment of cats outside. It was not unusually to see either a trash panda or a skunk out there eat alongside the cats. One had to be cautious and check, so as not to accidentally cause back porch chaos.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People! We have whale mics in Puget Sound. I did not know this until today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's a group of idiots sitting right behind the penalty boxes tonight. They seem unable to stay in their seats. I've yelled at them, people behind me have yelled at them, ushers have yelled at them. nevercomeback<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm ready to put my season ticket deposit down. Just tell me how much! NHLtoSeattle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the plus side, I figured it out because Twitter keeps suggesting that I follow them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had it happen before too, but there seem to be a lot this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter seems to have unfollowed a bunch of people for me. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, except now I have yet another email account, which has 50 messages that were automatically loaded. None of which I care about . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just called first college I attended to get electronic transcripts. "What was your school email account". "um, we didn't have e-mail back then". **silence** "Let me transfer you to the helpdesk". And now I have electronic access to a school I attended in the age of dinosaurs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Turns out you totally can in Anchorage. All their SUVs are 4WD. I had to call them direct and ask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got this as a promoted tweet. I have no idea what it says, but it sure is cute!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was one of the most fun NHL games I've been to. Didn't care who won, just went to see Barzal_97 and thomas_hickey14 play. Not only did they play, they both got points!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overtime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out Domi junior is a potty mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's not a ArizonaCoyotes, he's a sadpanda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the NYIslanders SeattleTbirds line with the goal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His name is Tyler. Figured it out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made a friend in Phoenix. But failed to get a name. Fellow SeattleTbirds season tix holder<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ewwww.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! I should have looked. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy next to me on this flight is going to eat an entire box of Tic Tacs on this shortish flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Handleoriginstory should be a thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah. Guy on the plane just whipped out his credit card and is reading it out loud on the phone to pay for tractor repairs. I now have his number, exp, and security code. Good thing I'm not that kind of jerk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently in the two month break from work travel, I forgot how. Left my headphones at home. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Apparently Phoenix is a popular place to go today. 48 people on the AlaskaAir upgrade list for this flight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle has become home to The Traveling Barzal_97 fans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to see him play in AZ tonight!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I recall, eventually the crowd got angry and started throwing them. Might have been after the other team scored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We liked the last one better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new ones are much softer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Winning at SeattleTbirds Chuck-a-Puck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized that I'm going to be in Phoenix at the same time as the NYIslanders. Also, ArizonaCoyotes tix are cheap. Think I'm going to go see Barzal_97 play again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody near us is wearing an overabundance of perfume or cologne. I'm starting to wheeze . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my tweets from 9 months ago started picking up traction again. I assumed bots, but some of them are people. Probably people who follow bots. Weird.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We've got a little wiggle room, so why not??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I guess this is fulfilling a campaign promise. Or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeesh. It's night of the backup to the backup goalie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And now there are two refs. Where did Brow materialize from??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's so cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As usual, Motley_Su rocked it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Traffic outside the ShoWareCenter is fubar tonight. Barely going to make the SeattleTbirds opening faceoff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Current problem though is the lack of budget is having noticable impacts on the number of courses offered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come to think of it, we also got to pick brand new seats in the pdxwinterhawks Rose Garden and in SeattleTbirds Showare Center.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were among the first on the list when WHLsilvertips came to town. Then somehow we fell off the list and had to get back on. There's nothing quite like picking your own brand new seats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just want to know when I can put my name on the list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do that with pant hens, but you can't just add pockets and fasteners!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thoughts are with all my Pierce County friends today. DanielMcCartney EOW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just ordered my annual allotment of StoneBrewing Farking wilw W00t Stout from tavour. Mmmmmm. beer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to go to the mall. I hate the mall. But I needed pants. Why is it so hard to find women's pants with short legs, pockets, AND fasteners??? This is one of the many reasons I hate the mall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was an associated text convo about that very topic, during the meeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love conference calls where lots of people work from home. Dogs barking, clocks gonging, mouth breathers ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except now this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just can't even at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been 36 hours of tags, likes, and retweets in Hindi. Seems to be tapering off finally. FingersCrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have several, but they at least live on their own network. I dread the day though when the TV and the lights get into a cyber street brawl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thankfully, your article was in English so at least I know what the excitement was all about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And apparently nobody checks before they tag. ScbaIndia isn't that hard to find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make it stop!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the Hindi retweets and tags continue. Whatever that's all about must be really exciting in the India legal world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This made me laugh harder than it probably should have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grrrrrrrrrrrr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Seattle shorts weather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently half of India thinks I'm ScbaIndia and my mentions are full of posts in Hindi this morning. Ugh . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to tag ScbaIndia, not me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Quit tagging me in your lawyer stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been exactly there. They make me sneeze!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this morning's edition of The Wonderful World of Windows, my login screen is nowhere to be found. Something recombobulated during the night, against my wishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did you tag me in this thread? I have no idea what you're talking about and I don't pass resolutions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'd rather be watching curling than this game . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now to decide if I'm actually going to put in a talk . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Migraine I guess. My migraine meds keep it in check, sort of. I just don't want to over do those and end up with a rebound. I do not want to be in the headache loop!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's where 50/50 winner came from too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw him. That's an exciting night right there. I assume at least, having never won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can attest to the fact that these new pucks do not hurt. The old ones did sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The contest is foam. The injury rate would be far too high with real ones!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hit with 2 Chuck-a-Pucks tonight too. Plus side though, cop picked up pucks off floor, chucked em, won somebody a prize.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's your carrier, AMZL US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. They turned down the EMAT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done. Again. This is not the first time. You really need to allow delivery instructions like the real carriers do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You misunderstand. I'm reporting it to you. And it's your direct delivery service. Your even put a photo of my blocked screen door in my account. This happens all the time with your drivers. The major carriers all allow, and follow, delivery instructions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just did. What would you advise? I would advise you to train your drivers in basic physics. Heavy object against outward opening door = door not opening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it so hard for amazon drivers to figure out that if they put a heavy box against my screen door, I can open the door to get the box???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The photo that failed to attach to that last tweet. ShoWareCenter SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear ShoWareCenter, this is ridiculous. What good is a pass gate when the line is this long? You need to triple your security staff for SeattleTbirds games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to send an officer back to the jail over after one of the women arrestees suddenly produced cash in her cell. When asked "you got anything else in there" she produced a checkbook, complete with cover. She had the cash in one hole, checkbook in the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My usual MO is to give permissions, then remove them as soon as I'm done. You could also create a dummy account to run it from and it would still work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As of next week: Taking one grad school class, auditing one grad class, teaching one grad class, teaching 2 undergrad classes, developing 1 undergrad class. Plus doing my other actual job(s). This is going to be an interesting few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now if only twitter had access to such magical data and could identify and ban bots on their own ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a cool and useful tool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're a Tbirds fan. You should be completely familiar with this type of situation!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That 4 hands, one keyboard thing really only works on pianos. But it was good for a laugh on that show.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have to admit I'm a little anxious about this one!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's what lives on top of the wine fridge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My kitchen isn't cold enough and doesn't have the space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I discovered last night that one of the compressors went out on my wine fridge. Of course it was the side housing white and dessert wine. FirstWorldProblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a long time ago though. Like when the Rose Garden (now Moda Center) opened. It was pretty awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I had season tix there, essentially yes. You were in the same general vicinity though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an epic snow bear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily we are the only people in this waiting room, as the stories contain considerable profanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my nephew is entertaining me with stories of basic training<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my sister's car. In the dark. This is is family trip for the record books.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only reason we made it up this icy damned hill was by driving the car in reverse. That was fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long night. Being entertained by my nephew who is hanging out with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The time is 0130. I'm sitting in an ER in podunk because one of my young relatives made poor drinking choices and probably has alcohol poisoning. It is helpful that we have two med pros in the fam. Saved us a 911 call. Also, why are hospitals on snowy hills??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We drove over it and didn't look back! I can only imagine what happened next. He was in the middle of 97, in a snowstorm. On a turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about this guy, who was stuck and in the process of stringing his winch cable across the highway to pull himself out. dumbass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clair's is so derpy. I got a piercing there in my early 30s. I didn't have ID with me, so they made my mom sign a parental waiver.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of these is facing the proper direction. I'll let you guess which one! Second spinout we've passed between SnoqualmiePass and Clean Elum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big snowflakes! wawx I90<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've decided that stuff left at our house by relatives is going back to them as gifts. My nephew is getting a can of PBR and a pocket knife. My brother, an autographed Lindsey Sterling post. Which we're framing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have done this. Twice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we've seen it over and over again in real life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may well be the funniest tweet I've read all year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I signed up all my family for haveibeenpwned. At least they get a notice when their stuff is on a list. After one of their accounts on my system was breached, I locked them out until they made better passwords at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know if the businesses on the other side of Main street are open or closed today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes me so sad. That's they nail shop I go to. All of those ladies have lost all of their business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These make me so sad for my city. So many people lost their homes and many others lost their livelihood. I'm thankful that everybody is ok, but this is the sort of thing that small businesses don't recover from. AuburnWA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now moving equipment and people out of the way because of collapse danger. North side of street evacuated too. So heartbreaking for my City. This is right in the heart of our downtown business core, that's down so much to revitalize these past few years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's something like the 8th one ever recorded since NWS started records!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vacation is definitely over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so very ready to be home. Though I travel a lot, it's rarely for this long. Had a great trip. Will do again. But not for a couple of years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched two movies on this flight. Dunkirk=excellent. Valerian=horrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter is made up of strangers though. And you never know who might rather call a stranger. When I was in 911, we took a lot of calls from strangers this time of year who wanted to die. Better to call a stranger than to die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last flight of the year. Thanks AlaskaAir for letting me swap my miles for these sweet Delta seats! They come with pajamas. iFlyAlaska MerryChristmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. My bag of cookies fell out of the overhead and whacked me in the head. We haven't even left the gate yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But beware that not all airlines will honor this. Delta just took my bottle and checked it for me. Even after I got charged extra for the special TSA approved clear plastic bag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey delta, why do you not follow this rule out of Hong Kong? I now have a bottle of booze somewhere in your cargo hold. Odds of survival = slim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ask myself that almost every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Santa found us! Thanks JWMarriott JWMarriottHK! MerryChristmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>14 hours left on the ground, then 12 hour flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Merry Christmas friends! MerryChristmas sky100 HongKong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The vacation is coming to an end, but it's ending in style. JWMarriott never disappoints, but JWMarriottHK is particularly impressive! Early check-in, room upgrade, immediate tea service. lovely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does my Delta One HKG->SEA ticket give me access to the HKG Sky Club?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Explains the itchy eyes and sneezing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not get it because I'm too much of a purist. I did get a regular one and it was delicious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not a fan of Uber, but it sure is convenient when you're in a country where you don't speak or read the language. Eliminates all sorts of confusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized that I know how to say thank you in Chinese thanks to firefly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2FA friend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, Hong Kong. Land of 4G again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've traveled to and from Alaska via plane, ferry, cruise ship, and highway. Each mode has a unique perspective!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys! My nephew made it home from basic training for Christmas! I'm not sure if my sis knows yet, as he got home at 0330 and was waiting for her to get up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I too am from Oregon. And I did not know this until right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how you win the Internet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally not lost. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally! I setup Google Auth forever ago, but they've always forced SMS regardless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It took CelebrityCruise less than 2 weeks to truly know me! thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new laws the were just voted in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I guess my taxes just went up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The secret to getting through immovable crowds in cruise ships is to act like you're going to barf or sneeze. Is like Moses parting the sea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, not sure. On either count. I'm trying to do this vacation thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was interviewed for an online magazine article. It published. It's weird. Misquoted and out of context stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread +<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lost any more emu lately?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have been watching this play out on international news as we travel today. Have traveled this road more times than I can count. So sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp, we're not going to see Danang. Got to the Port this morning and it's closed to all traffic. So we're headed to Halong Bay. Was looking forward to seeing the countryside. And to not rocking for 12 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bought them a new computer specifically to make remote support easier for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily, my folks are savvy enough not to trust things on the computer. Weird things generate a call to me or a brother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad misdialed the phone number for Social Security. He got a scammer instead, but didn't recognize that the questions being asked were not legit for SSA. He gave them his debit card number. So frustrating.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I call this the remote nope, from the little nope kitten. She looked right at the cam, flicked her little nope tail, and walked away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We finally found a country where projectfi has no service. Sad day. But yay for wifi calling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! That's not the kind of thing one should ever talk about. Or do. Gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feels like 106. And this is the cool season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Thailand! We have found Ye Olde Tourist Stop.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Matred (whose restaurant I threw up in 2 nights ago) asked about my tattoo. Me: I'm a disaster manager and it's every one I've lived or worked. Her (looking me straight in the eye with a smirk): I manage disasters too. owned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got to use my one word of Romanian again: mulumesc. That's twice outside of actual Romania. Thanking people in their native language always garners a pleased response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it turns out she lives ~30 miles from me . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly I have an invisible sign on me that says "free tech support". On a cruise ship, off the coast of Malaysia, random lady sits next to us and starts asking us about her iPad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! Have a lovely honeymoon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Port of Singapore is crazy busy. Seems like we're passing a never-ending stack of ships.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We managed to get the Seahawks game to stream from a cruise ship in Singapore. Unfortunately, the game sucked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've only been seasick one time, going across the Gulf of Alaska in a storm, on the ferry. Think my stuff ears may be in play here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a first I could have skipped. Barfed. At the table. In the nice restaurant. On the cruise ship. Moored at the dock. Butler already delivered meclizine. Nurse already called to see if she should quarantine me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cruise ship wifi is blocking my VPN. Grrrrrrrr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All hail the filbert!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tend to leave things like giant paper happy faces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes me happy. Unless it's a cute cat video, my reaction: "is there a transcript??"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a beer fridge and a tea cupboard. I go a little overboard on both!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the multiple people shooting him stink eye maybe got through. He's at least being more quiet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I weren't trying to get work done, I'd just tweet his whole convo. I'm sure Lenovo would love that . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do! I also like tea though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the techbro in the lounge behind me is averaging 1.5 F bombs per sentence. He's also divulging confidential contract info. stfu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know what kind of cheese that was, but it nearly didn't go down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking I would probably miss the Seahawks game tomorrow, since it's at 5:25 AM local time. But my brain hasn't really caught on to the time change, so there's a pretty good chance I at least follow it online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just posted a new blog: Dinner in Dubai<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My play list tonight: Bonnie Raitt, Sia, Etta James, Linkin Park, Garbage, 30 Seconds to Mars. Only thing they have is common is volume. Lots of volume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a volcano explode on the US mainland. And talking to our neighbors about it on phones with dials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I'm tired this morning. Just sat at a stop sign, waiting for the light to change. Monday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like that little wood in the engine thing cost us another 35 minutes. Bonus: because of the original delay, most of the food was 1/2 off and all the duty free was 20% off. We're all stocked up on Bailey's now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was supposed to be the 2PM sailing. Delayed 4 hours due to gale force winds! Gave us time to watch the football game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, idling out there while they fixed the engine took a toll on some I think. Mostly kids from the looks of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're pretty good now that we have momentum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annnnnd, it sounds like a parent failed to grab some meclizine for their offspring . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're gonna have to carry the banner from here on out Chad. His farming butt has been blocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some sort of hatch with a lot of annoying bolts from the chatter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh hell no! It's cold and dark out there! I bought a gin and tonic and waited it out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhh, there we go. Engine cleared of debris and we're off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And remember this convo with somebody on your team gets beaten with a blocker. Because you'll have zero cause to complain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to apply the can of Troll Be Gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently we have a small piece of driftwood stuck in one of the jets. Forcing it out with the engines didn't work, so we're basically idling across the Straight of Juan de Fuca right now while an engineer manually removes the stick. This makes for much side to side roll!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"there's some pretty big driftwood out here tonight and we're going to hit it in the dark. It's going to sound scary but it's normal and nothing to worry about".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't like being cursed at on the street. Which is what I guess the Victoria fans think is cool. Whatever makes you happy though I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"help yourself to the free basket of meclizine"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's gonna be bumpy. Horizontal rain outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My unexpected takeaway from going to the victoriaroyals games this weekend: local dub fans are not nearly as nice and welcoming as they used to be. SadDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sour grapes. I think it's great the Royals set a franchise record home win streak. I think it sucks that they had those icing calls against them that clearly weren't. And I think a goaltender beating a guy with his blocker should sit out the rest of the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha! That's funny right there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should "have".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The officiating was some of the worst I've seen. And it went both ways. That particular one cost us a shot at winning though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interestingly, Vic's backup goaltender thought Outhouse was going to get tossed. He was out of his folding chair (yes, really, folding chair) and starting to warm up in the walkway behind the bench. He was genuinely surprised to have to set his chair back up and sit down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They crash into us after they're done with Alaska. We've always sort of resented the fact that we have hurricane force winds, but don't get to call them hurricanes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downside to travel via boat in winter: 4 hour delay for return trip due to gale force winds. Luckily we had decided in advance to book an extra night at the condo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outhouse pretty much just lost his mind right there. VICvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never intentionally buy seats behind the bench. Yet here we are. Oops. VICvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We found a show on TV here called The Science of Stupid. It's amazing and we can't stop watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No way to put an attachment there. The missing points site says I have to send a copy of my bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. WestinLongBeach failed to credit me for 6 nights. Can't submit online because it was more than $500. spgassist requires a fax. A fax! What is this? 1990?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ferry ride home from Victoria tomorrow is going to suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That made it all the way to Vegas, huh??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That totally explains the difficulty the fans had spelling GO ROYALS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhhhh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At first glance, I thought Marty the victoriaroyals mascot was a bear. Upon closer inspection though, he's clearly a giant rodent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate kiss cams at hockey games. awkward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we appreciate the goals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Security guy just stopped to tell us how impressed he is by how well SeattleTbirds fans travel. He was surprised to learn the we just show up. There's no organized tour. VICvsSEA LetsGoBirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those were among the very best anthems I've ever heard. VICvsSEA hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are more! We probably had that many standing in front of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Victoria by night, all decked out for Christmas. @ Victoria, British Columbia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Root for Shea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My birthday is today and I'm getting really close to my goal of raising $1000 for the Auburn Food Bank. Will you help? GivingTuesday except actually Friday, :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Onhockey maybe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before my nephew left for the Army, he left a can of PBR on my guest bed, along with a decent knife. I'm keeping the knife, but saving that beer for him. He will drink it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's possible! There's also a 9 AM sailing today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the first time we've done it ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a birthday trip. On a boat. To another country. For hockey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread. Times one million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear AjitPaiFCC, please support NetNeutrality. We count on having unrestricted internet to connect with people during disasters. Don't create new barriers to reaching people who need help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had we started them as kittens, I think it would have worked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, my jumbo cats always had to have dog harnesses. Not that it mattered, since my cats immediate rolled over and assumed they were dead as soon as the harness went on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like it too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, but my trips nearly always turn into adventures!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just posted a new blog: How to plan an adventure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>November, you are seriously on crack. wawx summerinnovember @ Auburn, Washington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why they call it the Pineapple Express. It's suddenly 68 degrees outside and muggy. The outside of my truck windows fogged up when I pulled out of the garage. wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last two snaps from my nephew yesterday for a while. The floors of MSP and STL. Now he's in BF Missouri, starting his new life in the US Army. Godspeed kiddo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's not just me then??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so old. One of my students just described live TV in 1986 as the equivalent of streaming video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like it would be fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My home office cleanse continues. I found tax returns back to 1989. I made $353 that year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So today's phone phishing episode was brought to me by the kind folks at gotoassist, who apparently let their service be used to scam people. Ya'll might want to do something about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhh, he hung up on me finally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a horrible person. Apparently hackers are getting into my banking information via my broken firewall. I wonder how long I can keep this conversation going ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best phone scam ever. Told me my firewall generated the phone message. I'm now trolling them. HIlarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny thing is that it seems like about half the time, it actually was an emergency. They just didn't feel like it was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My birthday is soon. You can help me celebrate by making a donation to the Auburn Food Bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I have an invite for the call for speakers in my inbox! R4 might get tired of me though, since I'm doing their Advanced Academy all year. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't do yours because I have a teaching gig that week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wasn't for your conference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We replaced our conference badge QR codes last week with ones that pointed here:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Conference speaker proposal in Colorado turned down. There's another the same week in Nashville. Nashville is nice in April, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sarah's with November birthdays are the best!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel bad for them, but I too am laughing so hard I'm crying. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly? No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And agree that we need clear, safe ways to report AND know that action will be taken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were talking about this at home earlier. Original cons were very informal and to report bad behavior to somebody official was to also expose that you might be associated with something illegal and risk arrest (or at least unwanted attention). That culture stuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not going well in here . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty crowded in the Everett box. letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Debating whether to keep my First Aid/CPR instructor certification this next year. Hmmmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So excited to see that projectfi is supporting ITDRC with $$$. My fav phone service supporting one of my fav disaster response groups!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, they were very specific that it's about weapons. Only happens in Seattle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always forget that at SEA, they assume every locked pelican case contains weapons and they put it in a special place and make you show ID to get it. They don't tell you that though, you have to figure it out the hard way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly I'll miss smemchat this week. After spending the last 8 days with my IAEM17 friends, my plane is landing now and I'm going home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly 280 was made for sharing with friends!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spectacular view of Mt. Shasta this morning, courtesy of AlaskaAir. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going home. Doesn't get much better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know it's too early when you get to LAX before the AlaskaAir lounge opens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm blaming you for the siren that was just going off . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, I could start one, but the fire department would not be amused!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's stuffy in here now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funniest thing said in our room: I can feel the hair on my legs growing to compensate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So chayne_s, this might explain your problem. Maybe they hitched a ride to ATL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is the coldest classroom I've ever had to use. 3 calls to get it warmer, no joy. Freezing with MaryJoFly, Tarantino4me, and WxKyleNelson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My brain treats it like an activation, complete with changing roles 15 times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last day of IAEM17, teaching for DisasterCTR with WxKyleNelson! ndptc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The native app is all in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good use of your 280!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are several past presidents who are women, dating back to the 80s. I've known several of them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DM me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DM me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soooooo weary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was going to introduce myself to you at the CTC booth today, but I turned around and you were gone! So hi. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how networking usually involves food around here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me either. Pretty cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope that future IAEMThinkTank sessions on technology include the IAEMETC as well as a better representation of the diverse membership of iaem. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much cat herding!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure that's the most effective use of your new character limit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big data, AI, machine learning, live! IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several in development. That's what generated the discussion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing from FEMA. That was the point. Big data and AI/machine learning are the fix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry I had to run off iaemthinktank! The follow-up to my point is that changing human nature is hard. Florida hurricanes: people who don't need to evac do, blocking those who must go. It's about more than tech+policy. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on your roll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I disagree. Report and block!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Have to assign somebody just to report and block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also a not so cool example of bots learning. Some jumped on iaem17 with naughty pictures last night. This is why we can't have nice things. iaemthinktank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a great example of an EM chat bot put together by FITreadytogo used to provide mental health information to a community. You can find it on their website. Provided services to a community reluctant to ask a human. iaemthinktank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he was corrected this morning. It's more like a horse and buggy. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hanging with the nerds this morning. :) IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are a recruiter who uses AOL still, I'm probably going to take a hard pass on whatever you've got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quote of the day from Rich Serino: HAZUS is a flip phone. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude! You just missed your award!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Coke machine in my hotel is stalking me. Everytime I walk down the hall to my room, this. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ransomers also target healthcare because of the lax hygiene practices. Makes it easier to get. But again, that's the bad guy, not the ransomware itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting fact: most cyber ransomers are never caught. Mostly because incidents are never reported. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ransomware is equal opportunity: it doesn't discriminate between targets. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have an attack response plan: isolate infected device, secure backup data, activate incident response team. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prevention Activities: tested backup system, patch your stuff, upgrade plan for outdated devices. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ransomware is a business problem, not an IT problem. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next big thing in ransomware: IOT ransoms. Large police department had 60% of their security cameras held got ransom prior to a large event. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Security Onion is a free intrusion detection system you can install to help you monitor what's going on in your network. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best practice: don't login to your computers with Admin privileges unless you're performing an admin task. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best method for ransomware prevention: good digital hygiene. Want help with this? Visit the Crisis Technology Center in booth 711. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Key point: even if you pay the ransom, you may not get your data back. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many solutions to prevent ransomware are not difficult to implement, but you have to actually do it. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best practice: never open email attachments without confirming with the sender that the attachment is legit. And don't confirm via email, use the phone or text to a known number, not the one in the email. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Large number of ransomware delivered via spam or malicious web links. Traditional antivirus software largely ineffective. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hundreds of ransomware variants. Some even have chat built in to help you communicate with the ransomer. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most ransomware payments are made in crypto currency, which is often reinvested in further attacks. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$325 million paid last year to unlock ransomware. Average is $400-500 per unlock. Many people don't pay and either restore from backup or start over. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ransomware price list. How much will it cost you to regain control of your stuff? IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Research shows that hospitals are not attacked more often than other targets, but they lack the digital hygiene to protect themselves. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You might not want to tweet a QR code that reveals personal information!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally could have printed mini-slurpees!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching brindisi rock a quick smem presentation at IAEM17. Thinking she needs to be recruited for IAEMETC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so very, very sad. Rest in peace Steve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems like a valid point . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mind boggles at the size of the Port of Long Beach. It's humongous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meet Vigilance, the fanciest fire boat in the US. Be jealous doyle0213.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Queen Mary by night. IAEM17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My grandpa served in the US Navy during WWII. My granny, a civilian, drove the Navy recruit bus. My dad served in the US Army. My nephew leaves for Army boot camp in 9 days. Thanks to veterans past and future. VeteransDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My tripod broke. I discovered that I'm in Amazon Now territory. Replacement will be here in 3 hours or less!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They kind of took a turn when they were sold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I lucked into jiggling the power wire to the extruder in just the right way. This will surely not last though. Hopefully it makes it until my friends with screwdrivers arrive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How I spent my Friday night: troubleshooting a misbehaving 3D printer in a hotel room, without a proper screwdriver. iaem17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is . .. not good. The chocolate is overpowered by something unpleasant. It also turns into crumbs on contact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I know one of those guys! Cc: mdeyerin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's wicked smart and I have his jersey for the same reasons. And now it looks like he'll have plenty of time to work on side projects. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a totally dissatisfying conversation with support. Their answer was essentially "yeah, that happens sometimes and we're sorry". Basically told me to just change the batteries on a schedule because the monitor is crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm there. The news coverage of all of today's pursuits, along with all the giant traffic jams is what caught my attention!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't figure out how the have so many police pursuits in LA when traffic is pretty much gridlocked all the time. mysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read this thread. It was not the funny I thought it was going to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, that Seahawks play!!! And we can kick tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch out for rusnivek!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with early arrivals at big airports is that the gate you need is always full.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to do something about battery monitoring Misfit. Second time my Ray has gone from showing fully charged to dead in the span of an hour. Plus only getting about 3 months per change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me and Travel Butters sitting at SEA, waiting for our AlaskaAir flight to iaem17. See you all soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for the record, it's not really a burner. We call it that because it goes interesting places and get regularly wiped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Convos that only happen in nerd homes: Me: Guess where I finally found the burner phone. Him: I dunno Me: in your damned drone case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My insurance company hires private firefighters to try to protect homes they insure. It's included in my basic policy. It's not just for the wealthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>King County has reopened their application process for Training and Exercise Manager. Needs someone with strong T&E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My other pet peeve: the outrageous amount of money conference venues charge for Internet access in booths. And the restrictions they put on it. Anybody want to sponsor some awesome nerds?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government is the worst about this. The belief that a product without process will solve your problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why, WHY, do organizations buy software tied to business process, for which no actual process has been defined???? You can't fix lack of process with software. catherding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh burner phone, where are you? I've taken you many places, I've wrested you from the clutches of security. And now you're missing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for posting this! He's a friend but I did not know there was a fundraising effort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out it was running at the station. Medical Examiner arrived as we were pulling out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We we're lucky to stop at Kent Station. We're on the 180 now, headed for Auburn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a fatal on the tracks. We're getting off and taking the bus. Or an Uber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. All the south bound SoundTransit trains are stopped because of police activity at Auburn Station.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had great seats and many exciting things happened in front of us. Just not quite enough exciting things. Maybe next time Seahawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're rolling now. Second train is stuck behind us. We're later than it was even supposed to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They let us on the train, but here we sit. Waiting. Some train dispatcher needs a smack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The SoundTransit Seahawks train overshot the ADA ramp in Auburn. Needs to backup. Dispatcher not answering. stuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dressing for a cold Seahawks game is complicated when your heavy coat is red and they're playing Washington . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And dog food. They love dog food. So do skunks . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it sure likes grapes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'll be amused to know that one of my students just cited you in their discussion post. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, today I am thankful for my heated foot rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd be better with that. I hate cold rain. I want either snow or warmer rain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>37 degrees and rain. Meh. wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that too!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's because you come from snow country. We don't. We get excited for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. And your Super users like to mansplain how my needs are dumb. Not a positive experience at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried it last year. Did not meet my needs well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I looked at the list of improvements, but none of them seemed work $100 per year to access.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, when I finally got through, their rep was a rockstar. Just took a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't work well for the business side of what I do. I actually use the business tools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody found a good option to replace quicken with? Not a fan of this whole subscription thing. Feels more like ransomware ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear enom: maybe hire more customer service people?? Last ticket took over a week to answer. Now have critical issue and stuck on hold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I give out mini Playdough containers to trick-or-treaters. Some kids are so excited! For the rest, I have candy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yellowstone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. You'll just have to be content knowing that you were the final footnote on a customer lost after 17 years. Have a nice day ^JaCS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, you just told a social media instructor to RTFM about Twitter? You need to do this part if you want non-follows to DM you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don't seem to accept DMs from non-follows. aka: you've asked the impossible, further demonstrating why we're leaving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is horrible. Can't cancel my account. Last week they told hubs I had to do it. Today told me he had to. Then told him I had to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot mine on Thursday. My feet were in such agony I couldn't sleep that night. Remembered them the rest of the week. Problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>12-14 hour days on our feet. They make a huge difference in feet and leg muscles. Way less tired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Volunteer came up to me today and informed me I changed her life two years ago when I told her about compression socks. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had to hand sanitize my ear. Such are days at the clinic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if I should like that or not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the best feeling when you lead people who get to choose their own job and they choose to work for you again. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always good to come home! Thanks for getting us here early AlaskaAir. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was still standing room after it left Auburn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This SoundTransit train to Lakewood is completely packed. Standing room only. Even after Tukwila stop. People laughing though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People come from the Peninsula for care. I've talked to people from as far away as Idaho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an amazing event, staffed all by volunteers. This is my 4th year helping. Just finished setup Day 2!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow AlaskaAir is getting us home from New York almost an hour early, even after we left late. CrazyGood IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh avis. Somehow 3 of 4 past rentals have somehow switched from points to miles. Why?? How to fix? annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then there was gate confusion. Called first class, then uncalled it, then loudly uncalled it, then immediately called it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our AlaskaAir boarding at JFK is delayed due to a "security search". Never heard that before . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Found another hockey loving EM in New York this week. Awesome memorabilia in his office. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is it that JFK, one of the largest domestic airports, has no designated pre-check in Terminal 7??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I put mine in the trash and ordered a new one, which will get to my house before I do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's probably something I'll never see again! Riveters vs Team Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of clarity can be found on deployment, if you're looking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russia's tallest player is 13" taller than the Rivs shortest player. Definite size advantage there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second Riveters game. Banners in this place are a bit more impressive than the last! rivsnation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah, fairly new one. Definite crush injury!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly it was crushed by something, but I have no idea what!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time I've had that happen. My fav short USB C cable. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool VirginAmerica photo on approach to JFK. That's the moon off the wing tip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this whole thread. I did two workshops last year for little old ladies. They actually take it to heart!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the Scotty dance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I picked red, but only for Command. Line dies too often!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I know what I'm spending my Barnes and Noble credit on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a plane, so going to be a few hours probably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be out on Long Island till early Tuesday morning. Might go to NJ tomorrow night for hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We haven't even closed the plane door yet and I think the person behind me is having a panic attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My LAX->JFK leg is first trip on VirginAmerica. The pink lighting is trippy! The seat back ordering is awesome! iflyalaska BetterTogether<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the bright side, the AlaskaAir Lounge spicy bloody Mary tastes the same either day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so confused today. I never travel away from home on Saturday. I keep thinking today is Sunday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. Another question I can't find answer to: do you offer mailing lists with any of your account tiers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a plane, so haven't gone to that city's website, but I generally trust that BBC vets their stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day to kill in New York tomorrow. Thinking about going to the Riveters game. Even brought my jersey . . . RivsNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>0430 is a horrible time to leave for the airport. Only plus is no traffic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate those moments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I doubt it. I don't take expensive things to hockey games, lest I throw them in the air, whereupon gravity sets in and they break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found my old Canon AE1-P camera. It still had film in it. I have no idea what might be on there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still no reply ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently a sure way to attract bots is by tweeting about football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen otherwise ethically behaving people behave abhorrently in response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. That. And it can be easy to forget the big picture ethical situation I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen it too many times to be surprised. Always disappointed though in my fellow humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, WTF is wrong with people? Who does this? I love my town. I hate that this is happening. I don't want us to go down this road.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lovely minority owned restaurant in town had shit thrown on it last night. Not the first thing that's happened to them, but the worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking more for intro to students on the concepts of ethics in EM, primarily around decision making. Basically ethics 101 with EM flavor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found one!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't take bags to sporting events!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Complete destruction of many structures. They can't be fixed. Must be rebuilt, but sense is many under-insured. Or not insured. 5/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lack of understanding on part of local officials on how to report/track damage for reimbursement. Lack of timely ability to haul debris. 4/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heavy reliance on tourism, but no place for tourists to go now. Also many 2nd/3rd homes. No true local connection. 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rental owners not local. No connection/incentive to rebuild. Huge, expensive infrastructure damage. Small local budget already. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Key reasons I saw: Destruction of tax base. Larger renter population moved immediately. No jobs or homes to bring them back. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That article is inaccurate BTW. No surge there. All wind damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live here. Watch ever game. Just have never been able to get tickets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the town I was in post-storm. So many factors were apparent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't even have a theory for why this is. There's certainly plenty of material!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to awesome friend, we now have tickets to our first Seahawks game!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's what we always called him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the small truck. Big one still coming!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have selected some real duds before and then got told "everybody knows they suck". Clearly not everybody knew or we wouldn't have picked!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People knowing survivors of one of the game recent incidents. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Initially, it was definitely a shortage. Now, that shortage is being compounded by fatigue. But just from volunteering, but from so many 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not really anything reportable. It would just come across as GET OFF MY LAWN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmm hmmmm. Make derp just made a strange reference to crazy redheads. There are four of us who sit right here . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last time these two were here, they referred to people who like good beer as hipster trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Derps are yelling that the ref isn't doing his job when he's standing there with his arm up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow, missed my jersey. Just got my neck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the derps just dribbled beer on my neck. And probably my game worn Stankowski jersey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! Had some weird install issues, but all good now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, it's not their spawn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Derp and derp are here again tonight. And they seem to have brought spawn with them. Could be a long game.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sorry I missed smemchat today. Could have had an old-school nerdout with eTechOps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you've said. Other registrars make it happen in far less time. One more reason I'm glad I've left your company.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It was 20 years before Mt. St. Helens closed out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recovery takes years tho, during which time FEMA remains. Mt. St. Helens took 20 years to close out. Shortest one I've managed was 6 months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be safe!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a really important thread, particularly in a disaster recovery context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also think that this lack of understanding is in our own ranks. Lot of people get into this field, but don't truly grasp whole picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, BUT, if EM continues to fail to meet expectations and we can't set different ones, maybe we need to change our way of doing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use an independent broker. They know about all the kinds! The common companies don't offer it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Renewed my earthquake insurance today. That's a $2300 bet on disaster ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why yes, yes we do! So glad he got invited and got a contract. He was the of our team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went with eNom for this one. Ease of use and ease of integration with G Suite for this small non-profit. Plus they're local to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In honor of national cybersecurity awareness month, I finally sent in my paperwork and got certified as a Cybersecurity Manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a cybersecurity panel at a 911 conference on Thursday. Should probably put actual talking points together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pitiful interactions with 2 EnduranceIntl companies today. Hopefully my last ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, we have 2 different registrars that got scooped up by EIG. As of today, we're done with them. Using eNom for 2 diff Soroptimist clubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now of course Dotster is holding one of the 3 domains hostage. Keeps generating an invalid transfer code. ugh ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went with eNom. They're local, even though they got bought by a Canadian company. Very basic hosting + G Suite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm limiting to those two because they have very easy integration with Google Suite, which the non-profit can use for free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoops. Coming back this way now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it's the middle of suburbia, so that's not really an issue. The dog knows which scent it wants. The scared, sweaty one!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anyone I know use enom? Their web hosting features list is not very detailed. Trying to decide between them and GoDaddy for non-profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I solved the issue by transferring all of my domains and hosting to another company (that isn't owned by enduranceintl. ProblemSolved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. I'm so done with asmallorange. Unauthorized password change. Lost payment. Completely idiotic customer support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope they just came for the beer and nachos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear GoldenKnights, in Seattle we combine hockey and doggos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the shot counter is under counting tonight too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would have settled for just a shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor RealmofHelm sounds like he's announcing a funeral at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's door person failed to wand my entire left side or anything below my waist, soooooo . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I have things to ponder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TdC says happy vivisection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Would work here most of time. Might look off at outdoor summer venues!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have one in each car, in each disaster kit, and in my every day carry bag. But I generally don't take bags into event venues because PITA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Large venues need to consider installing bleeding control kits, right next to the AEDs. Some buildings in Seattle have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>End of 2nd. Contenders for of the night: goal light helmet guy wiener dogs dabbing Grandma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy with the goal light helmet probably deserves first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Derp just proclaimed "it looks like a different team from last year!". Yeah, that's what happens in the Dub honey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd normally be nervous that our goaltender has a plain white helmet and pads from some other team. But tonight, it'll do. Hurry back Stank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Name one guy in blue who's on his game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently we don't woo if the other team scores before our goal gets announced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scratch that. Now you can go meet the new guy, Hughes. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear defense. I realize you haven't met, but Berlin, your goaltender, would really like to meet you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be classified as horrible so far, but there were wiener dog races, so that made up for some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sort of excited to BrianLiesse's photos of this. He had the best view!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weiner dog races on ice are way funnier than I imagined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a lot of derp in the seat behind me tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woohoo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear refs: you might want to leave your wallet in the officials room next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neoeric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little kid next to me has hands to ears whole time. So that's another vote for yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said the same thing to my husband. "That's never gonna get old".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's one notable absence from the list because he blocked me. And no, I have no idea why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a reminder for SeattleTbirds fans. I made a Twitter list of fans I've found. Watch us cheer and cry together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two weeks into SeattleTbirds season and I'm finally sitting in my seats!! LetsGoBirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I covered 3 rows in red wine. Lady turned around to tell at me and it was dropping out of my hair and running down my face. She said nada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's ok. My hitting turned into hiring, which just made it weird . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hiring a deer with a plane has to be a very rare thing! I was on a flight one that hit a pocket and dropped straight down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love to fly, but I'll pass on this experience!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nephew is trying to join the army. He has rapidly caught on to the concept of "hurry up and wait".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come visit Seattle in about a week. Or anytime between then and about May. We generally have a lack of great firey orb sightings then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably punishment for asking to be verified. denied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of a sudden, Twitter has decided my perfectly valid cell phone number cannot be validated. It was previously validated, but now, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Er, Keegs. Stupid autocorrect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Down to minors. At least he'll get to play with Keeps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like SurveyMonkey is finally going to force me out of my old Pro plan. Debating whether I want to pay the extra $ for fewer features.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorted through 3 boxes of work stuff. Only thing I'm keeping: a bunch of binder clips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every player I was excited about is now gone. I guess my Knights fan days were very limited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nooooooooooooooooooooo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I assume this one was a Russian bot since that seems to be their bread and butter these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reported an obvious fake account on facebook. Their response: "it doesn't violate our terms of service". wtf fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Definitely needed margaritas to be palatable. But lunch, so no booze for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is awesome! hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that seems unfair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always fun to be in a training with somebody you one deployed with and haven't seen since. emlife emreunions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know Dean. And reading this, I'm bawling over my dinner. "Auburn firefighter hailed in Vegas massacre."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there go the complaints on Nextdoor. Everybody convinced there's a manhunt . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flight school half mile away. Apparently tonight is helo night landing practice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, and according to this training, we're supposed to "hover over" text message links to verify authenticity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My takeaway from this is that Miranda is an idiot ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time for my annual 45 minutes of kevinmitnick security training. Thankful for two monitors ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there's the request to go to Puerto Rico. Can't go there either right now ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be safe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was May I Have This Dance by Francis and The Lights. Gregr played it this morning. How is it not Peter Gabriel though?? Sounds just like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was the song you played right around 4 today, right before the commercial break before the Chili Peppers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot seems to be machine driven. I had to really crack down on what my Surface does in the background.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got asked the weather control question last week. I literally just walked away and got a drink at the bar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wasn't necessary referring to any specific incident. There are so many right now and all will likely lead to some change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In public policy, we call these moments focusing events. Bad things nearly always lead to policy change because people are focused on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just impatiently waiting for the day that the whole fleet covers to satellite instead of terrestrial coverage! NerdDreams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh gogo, today's alaskaair flight 23 has one of the worst connections I've seen. My stuff timing out. Seat mate's stuff timing out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a law in WA that allows 30 days of practice with out of state license in times of emergency. Every state could do that at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad to hear it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not discounting what's going on. Only pointing out that the story is better told with authentic photos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a reminder to VERIFY PHOTOS before you share them. Drag them into Google Images or TinEye. It takes like 10 seconds. EMLife smem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That photo is from 2013.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This +<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could team up on a journal article. Part of the issue stems from our broken public assistance process. That's a whole other rant though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FEMA is 100% deployed across all of these disasters. Nothing left to send. Additional help has to come from other agencies and/or military.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what took me so long to publish my donations article. I was still pretty agitated about some things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI, that link no longer works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two of my favorite things right there. Gogo and Boeing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like he suffered from a case of grabby hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope! Just an LSU shirt . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure lawyer next to me at airport lounge is breaking all sorts of confidentiality. I now know the entire story of Dr being arrested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switched browsers. Mostly fixed the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is the theory to practice disconnect. The bigger issue is getting the research in the hands of practitioners in meaningful ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This gets the holy crap of the day award. Best of luck to Mr. Koon in his new gig at IEM. Best of luck to Florida. Gonna need it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Which is exactly what we expect in a Cascadia quake. Cut off by mountains to the east, ocean to the west, and mass damage north/south<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG LinkedIn could your article publishing tool be any worse????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching what's going on in Puerto Rico and thinking that's pretty much going to be the Pacific Northwest when Cascadia quake happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ugly factor has gotten really bad. Doing SM monitoring for disasters takes a much stronger stomach than it used to. Hate overwhelms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Called for annual doc appointment. They got slurped into a conglomerate. First available appt is 3 weeks out. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally sent in my cybersecurity manager certification packet. Passed the test months ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate giant conference calls. How come nobody can mute their phones???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget IDTRC. They brought us internet, then the newly created FB page got supplies rolling in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm noting glaring policy differences between PR and Texas/Florida. Frustrating. But destroyed infrastructure + island are huge barriers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not aware of one. I have friends in same plight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just one more reason hackers are awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope you have the insurance. That's probably like a $5k wiper to the rental agency . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting thread from Twitter Policy. The comments though highlight their inconsistency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what I dislike about ORD: the half hour of driving the plane around the airport looking for a parking space once you land.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very powerful photos from PuertoRico<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it occurs to me that FlaPanthers start out as fluffy kittens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because there's a huge lack of fluffy kittens in the NHL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please let it be a fluffy kitten!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"or our new protein enhanced shake?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly I need to go to DerbyCon next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for streaming that!! Was it wrong to watch it from the wedding reception??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes indeed. And he avoided puking on my feet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10 year old member of wedding party dashed off stage and puked. As the nearest seated non-affiliated adult, well, I made a new friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I'm at the bar. And he's sitting next to me. Asked me if I've had my IQ tested. This could be a very strange evening. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you in Austin or Houston?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got asked if the hurricanes were due to weather manipulation. I said the first thing that came to mind: "I'm getting a drink at the bar".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5th airport since Monday. Hello BHM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the greatest things about my AlaskaAir Lounge membership is getting to use AmericanAir Admiral's Club. Fresh made guac!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When one of the small non-profits you support says "hey, our pwd protected site is giving us porn" and your scan says every file infected...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did they ever say what happened to Stankowski?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just about took my nose off putting my bag in the overhead. It sort of hurts now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love 30SECONDSTOMARS shows!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where were you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no concert is complete without my Etymotic earplugs. Long live my hearing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good seats for muse, 30SECONDSTOMARS, and ThisIsPVRIS at RedRocksCO. musicislife MusicMonday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a music break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read the thread nerds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found my boonie hat! I thought it was lost in Texas. Turns out I put it in a secure pocket of my big pack and forgot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Less than an hour until RAIN! I'm legit exited about this. Finally the smoke will flush out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The little kitty is wandering through the house mrowing at the top of her lungs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now a clipping call. It's the refs night to prove they read the rule book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can honestly say that's the first time in nearly 25 years of watching hockey that I've heard them call slew footing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There will be so many pics!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a little pre-season SeattleTbirds hockey! Sadly we're going to miss opening night. Somebody post lots of pics!! LetsGoBirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you the new RealmofHelm tyler_thomas12??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's one in Dubai. I have reservations at it in December!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think they'll have any trouble finding them homes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe how smoky it is at home again. Thankfully supposed to rain tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate going to the post office. 15 people in line. One clerk who's not in a hurry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband told me about this last night. It makes a lot more sense with a phone. I envisioned wooden pole, which made no sense!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second deployment request. This one for Florida. Can't go though. At least not for a couple of weeks. EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure! Don't want to duplicate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm working on my ideas for next year's defcon CFP. I'm going to call it Hacking Disasters. It'll take me that long to narrow content.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, look at that. My GU boss on the TV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for sponsoring today's TheNetworkNWHRN breakfast sabey. It's a great event! emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a plan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoot, there it is! Hello AlaskaAir Gold 75K for another year. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two close friends working this for days. One with structural fire strike team, one working LE in the CP. Also relative in poss harm's way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emergency Management technology related job in Tacoma. EMLife EMJobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My lifegear flashlight was so excited to see me that it spontaneously started flashing red. It won't stop! Had to pull the batteries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Descent into SEA has started. Thanks once again AlaskaAir. iFlyAlaska p.s.: this is my 75k flight for this year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mid-flight, this horrible sunburn decides it's going to itch and peel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister didn't have enough carriers for their evac from Irma. Turns out a laundry hamper and bungee cords can fix that problem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a plane home to do just that!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping to visit them next year for the annual Hummer Bird Festival. This year's was supposed to be this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Headed home from a week serving the residents of Rockport. Incredible devestation. Equally incredible resolve. texasstrong rfstrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I'm apparently too tired to tweet coherently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He didn't find it. Now a flight attendant is searching for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody's phone launch on take off. Then some guy decided to crawl did the aisle of first class looking for, while we were still climbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many doggos! Such an awesome guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leslie is one of my students!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you must be in Alabama then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where are you? We just demobed in Texas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a big shout-out to IDTRC and Green Cross Academy of Traumatology for being our partners on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an actual photo from Rockport. We didn't tackle this pile, but we got a lot of others dealt with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I would never have imagined saying we lacked spontaneous volunteers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm boggled at the low number of volunteers here in Texas. Like seriously. It's been our biggest headache in Rockport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This times 1 million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Later in the week. And more words than Twitter!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will elaborate on this thought later, but it's a big, big thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My view of donations management has been forever changed this week. Emergency managers, we need to rethink our position on this. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I've been preaching it too! We had three small ones in my city in 2015. First one was in March!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you ever wonder about the emlife world, the new PSC in the small county I'm helping in is a personal friend. smallworld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happily, all my family eventually decided to evacuate Florida.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've turned three able-bodied adults away in an hour because they have little kids with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear universe: do not bring your small children to help with major disaster relief. It's not safe for kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a lot easier to help with Harvey relief knowing my sister is now safely out of Irma's path.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glorious moment when you spot the dish van rolling up the street with the VSAT! Thanks IDTRC for making it happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no waffle House here. We're using the liquor store index. It was open this morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found these awesome Riviera School District Seahawks helping with Harvey relief in Rockport! Cc: Seahawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're cooking with gas today! Thanks ITDRC for helping FITreadytogo support the Rockport Donation Center!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister left Tampa almost 14 hours ago, headed for Tennessee. Still driving. Sarasota family decided to stay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so covered in Deet that it would have had to be a particularly stupid mosquito.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just killed a mosquito on the wall. With my phone. We don't know whose blood this is, but it's a significant amount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, it allows autopilot to kick in to make up for lack of sleep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got it handled. Thanks MarcBurdiss!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or don't have so many roosters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there an smem or vost person out there who's good with Google docs who could spend 30 minutes on a project for me for Rockport?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The FITreadytogo command post in it's newest temporary location. sempergumby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw this last night right before I went to bed. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen zero pets since we got here. No power, no water, few people. And honestly, we're more worried about the wild boars then rats!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure there are more bags of pet food in that donation center then there are pets in the whole county. tired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our FITreadytogo team is sharing space (and food) with ITDRC and TeamRubicon today. partners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Combo of sleeping on the sofa, much activity, much to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brain just wouldn't shut up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 0240. Have to be up at 0530. Can't sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was hot and sweaty! The excitement had worn off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I can't spell today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy crap. Just watched super sleepy guy nearly role his truck, miss two overpass supports, land in the grassy shoulder. He's ok. Trucks ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was strategic. It got moved to the top upon emptying the cart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sis is all over it. She had to replace her out of area contact though since I'm deployed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's where my sister lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Report from home: everything covered in fire ash. No local threat, but very unhealthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a kitchen. And a designated cook. It was her request!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I just got the "Please give us your availability" notice from my EMAT team at home. Reply: none<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Everybody is good to go. Sis had to nominate a new out of area contact though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in Texas doing Harvey relief work. My sis in FL is prepping for Irma. My aunt just got Level 1 evac notice in WA for fires. Strange week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring your credit card and your Costco card! And find a ride. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Team shopping for provisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have to be part of a public safety agency, at which point your supervisor can point you in the right direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same as Alisha. We're both here with FITreadytogo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Further south.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm here too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wrote a thing on this: How to help after a disaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are odd. Guy next to me on the plane ate chicken from his salad with his fingers and is shoveling quinoa in his mouth with a knife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good lord it's smoky down there. And thanks for the Mountain flyby AlaskaAir. iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for taking us and all our stuff to Texas AlaskaAir. HarveyStrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Told my nephew that solution to his phone prob might be to put it in hot oven for a bit. He did. It worked, at least for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm teaching ethics. Maybe I'll work his appointment in . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony of deploying to Texas this week is that my own state (WA) is on fire. Could end up being needed here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preseason hockey: rookies slower, rougher, often where they should have been too late. Vets: quicker, faster, anticipate plays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This gap between the penalty box and the crowd seems problematic WHLsilvertips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McKay hasn't quit chirping since he had a seat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw in today's brief that there was an amendment related to cost sharing. Haven't dug to find out what it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could be. Still doesn't jive with PA program reqs though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes no sense. Stafford Act should only kick in once local/state funds are expended. No supplanting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May the hockey gods forgive me. I'm wearing sandals to a hockey game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting note for smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Just don't lose it. I once had govt emp who wrote all on sticky and affixed to back of ID badge. Incl PINs to keypad entries. Lost it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I had to re-follow a bunch of Twitter accounts that I know I was already following. What's up with that???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're using it to support our SA before we deploy on Tuesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger that! Super useful info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The map keeps throwing an error for me. Wants to access my location, but can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. comcastbusiness outage. I have stuff to do tonight, but I guess I won't be doing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you ask me, yes. If you ask sct_r, there is nothing on the planet better than VIA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully this will be enough coffee for me for the week . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1. SBTaskForce, OR-VOST, FSU-VOST smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never seen so much simultaneous VOST activity. Both teams I'm on were activated to support fed partners. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of news corporations partners with charities, so one would think that employees of those stations might have toe the corporate line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Headed to Texas next week with FITreadytogo to do HarveyRelief. Looking forward to making a difference for some people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally put my actual face on the Twitter ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. That could be a real issue for records retention laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For some reason, a tweet I made more than a year ago is suddenly getting traction again. So weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know! Who plans a wedding without checking the hockey schedule??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice shout-out to dispatchers from NWS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're sadly going to miss opening night. Family wedding in another state. I trust you all to tweet many photos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And even then, the money is for rebuilding it the way it was, not the way it needs to be. At least not without extra hoops to jump through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure what this is all about, but pretty sure it has nothing to do with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my brother is in Japan right now. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm amazed and impressed by the fact that there have been so few deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better to be wet than dead on a flooded highway somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just laughed so hard I have tears running down my face. I needed that. Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just laughed wayyyyy too hard at this thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I don't think about too often, but my great-grandmother was a Houston. Yes, those Houston's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We get so wrapped around the axle about process sometimes that we get in our own way. Plus we look like jerks doing it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have to be. Not our place to tell the community "wait, stop, you're helping wrong!". Help is help and everything is local.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right? Some things do not scale well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good option is always TeamRubicon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's something to kill you everywhere. Had this discussion with somebody earlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread pretty well sums up the issues of evacuating a large city.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were rescued several hours ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But added them to the list before I sorted out my own confusion. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. I was in fact very confused. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be safe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing a SBTaskForce deployment today in support of USCG response efforts. Not even in the worst of it yet probably. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were rescued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have the knowledge and science to save lives. And yet many will be lost again because people don't want to believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daylight is going to reveal a lot of devastation in Texas. Be safe friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Less heat island effect out in the burbs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Live feed from rockport harvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in case you were wondering if anything else was going on in the world today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally got it to work. The link you sent was completely wrong. I needed to download/install the CiscoVideoGuard, no the DirecTV player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my takeaway from this that you have inept website maintenance and buggy software. And for $153/mo, your stuff should just work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I did manage to download, but following the workaround URL (you really need to fix that), but the .msi won't extract correctly. Now what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. It says you need to update your weblinks so they point where they're supposed to. Maybe you could provide the correct link?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never thought about what happens to cruise ships that can't get back to port. I guess they probably have enough supplies, but still ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. DIRECTV viewer won't download on my computer. 404 error. Phone all keeps crashing. Big $$$ for bad products. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! I end up having to print the whole screen, when really it just needs one piece of paper. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's one thing that would make my AlaskaAir experience better: if the print button produced a receipt that says "non-refundable ticket".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking of all my friends and students deploying to Texas right now. Be safe everybody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found myself at new ImpactHubHNL for WetWareWed tonight, where they were kicking off Hawaii Annual Code Challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto. It was also the night manager though. And talked to a colleague who had the same issue at this location two weeks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm talking about you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Marriott, when I book government rate, then show up and am told it's only for military, that's false advertising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dad had interesting stories of chicken behavior from eclipse. He always has stories. They just don't usually involve the sun going out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Introducing a new friend to the happiness that is the AlaskaAir Lounge. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure that one was great to announce . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto the ladies shirts, but also normal sized ones. Ones I did find in vendor area and DC swag booth ran VERY small.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eclipse selfie. Note the reflected crescent . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crescent shaped shadows. Eclipse Eclipse2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blue looks like scissor handles. Orange looks like a D-ring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area highway sign: Eclipse Traffic to Oregon. Expect delays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get ridiculously excited when I see my cats in the food dish webcam. LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ticket agent at MCO AlaskaAir desk told me I'm the first Gold 75K member he's meet. He seemed excited. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except I can close Twitter. I can't mute this lady or her call. And I think she was just kissy facing her dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people have speaker phone convos in public spaces???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knocked out my first live, public, acapella anthem today. Guess I've joined the ranks of anthemsinger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I.e. do I believe the volcano will generate a lahar in my lifetime? No. Do I have a plan for it? Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. We plan for all sorts of things that might never happen. We do consequence management and related planning for things that might happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just discovered that Periscope connects to Facebook now. I need to pay closer attention!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was afraid of failing the ISO 27032 cybersecurity test. I passed handily. Next week I start first course of MS in Analytics. More scary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing quite like getting sick on the road. Thanks to premera's Teledoc service though, I talked to a doc for $4 and got a scrip locally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have paid staff and tripods!! My mini tripod can deal with my travel camera, but not my phone. But I'm working on it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe. Complicated since everybody should be paying respects to the flag at the same time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Classically trained pianist. Though I suffer from "stupid fingers" now! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wasn't here for your 454!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I'm singing the national anthem for this week's FEMA Region 4 Advanced Academy graduation. It's an honor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going DM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And to add insult to injury, I had to strain cork bits out of my with my teeth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I accidentally bought gross salsa. It's fresh, but it has sugar added. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My grandpa, step-grandpa, and most of my great-uncles. And my granny drove a Navy recruit bus. Everybody did their part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot that these billets have no irons. My ability to dress professionally for the week just got complicated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. Has to be Eastern Oregon or Washington.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at an angry wildfire, in the dark, from the air. Guessing Montana.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sort of hoping that this red-eye flight will end up having a good view of the meteor shower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that AlaskaAir flight attendants are rocking both t-shirts & suits on this flight. Everybody looks happy w/their choice! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is the law though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not thinking about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. Her reply was absurd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's where I am right now . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have socks, baggage tag, and charging cable already. Going for the full set!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scored some projectfi socks at the flywithfi travel trolley. Niece has already shed the sandals in favor of socks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you were wondering, pancakes and Shirley Temples are apparently an excellent evening snack!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lady next to him patiently explained that daughters don't always have their father's DNA. Ima just stay over here, out of harm's way. wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy mildly freaking out in airport lounge because he did his DNA test for family history and his daughter didn't come up as a match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She already asked if we'll have time for pancakes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to take my niece on her first jet. To Hawaii. Thanks for the upgrade too AlaskaAir! She'll now be spoiled for life! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming from a place where an EF-0 is a big deal, I would always go with a pro!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of those things I wouldn't mention to my dad until after . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My plan is to use some set of credentials and get connected to a university research team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Storm chasing is on my bucket list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a VE (volunteer examiner), so I help give tests sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I too am a ham radio person. For 20+ years now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advantage of my old job: I know where a local fed continuity site is, complete with dusty old radio! They were excited to show it to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then again, not even sure what I would plan for at the local level for a West Coast City. It's not as though we had/have any capacity for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to explain to my city council that it was actually illegal for me to do this kind of planning. They thought I was crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody ever believes me when I tell them this!! emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want to send that to the dude who accidentally shot my nephew (he's gonna be ok). It would probably be inappropriate though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Told my niece her hair is about 30 years older than her. And that she should be a rock star.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>13 yr old niece visiting. Mildly bored. Introduced to khanacademy. Haven't seen her in an hour now, as she's busy learning geometry. STEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was too late actually. Moved things out of the way. Put a container to catch dripping water . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someday I'm going to do a house project because I want to, not because some damned thing decided to leak and destroy. Today is not that day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just donated to my cousin's project! Help me bring a classroom dream to life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's pretty awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's entirely too warm to be snuggled by a 20 pound fluffy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Training teenagers in CERT today. Such fun! Eager to learn, few barriers. No preconceived notions of how it all works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was pretty much my reaction to that article too. Only difference is I actually won money this year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of my electronics got a virus at defcon, but I did. concrud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was just kind of funny to see the number of people volunteering to bump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>27. I'm good tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't remember the last time this happened. AlaskaAir oversold this flight. People are dashing to the desk though to volunteer for later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for nothing avis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad you enjoyed it! We'll come back any time. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, they fixed it. They had me for 2 nights and said I wasn't mobile checked in. I was looking at my phone which said 1 night & checked in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both avis and sheratonhotels managed to screw up my reservations today. Me: but I'm LOOKING AT IT. I'm so ready to go home . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should I answer that social media question? Here's a good guide. SMEM NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sent you a DM. Can you check it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good news: power is back on at the hotel. Bad news: I locked my room keys in the room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I worked with a guy in his 70s in 1997. He got offered a ton of $$$ to fix things, so came out of semi-retirement to bust his butt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To this day, don't know why copy wasn't dumped on new box with date rolled forward. Would have saved much pain . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had just spent $$$$ on a new dispatch sys bcuz old one was maybe not Y2K. Old one just kept chugging along at midnight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was just thinking about this on my flight away from summer camp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was working OT shift as a 911 dispatcher. There's a funny backstory involving a very old Foxpro database. Hubs was in a cellular NOC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Illinois. Middle of the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big thunderstorm rolled through and zapped something important. About half the town seems to be out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hotel power still out and emergency lights on my floor have failed. Most important thing in my bag today is my Streamlight Nano. prepared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downside of being prepared: still have to work from powerless hotel room because my hotspot works and my devices are charged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally get into the hotel and the power is out. Fun times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy Midwest thunderstorm. Sitting in my car because lightning seems to be directly overhead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not sure how I feel about this photo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a great day in Dixon.Thanks for having us! NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the sweet ride avis! Brand new Volvo XC90.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was the coldest plane trip I've ever had. Brrrrrrr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that the Marriott app has let me know my room is ready. I haven't even boarded my plane. Looking forward to a nap on arrival tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ultimate vandaleyes defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You forgot the 3 adorable dogs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goodnight defcon. Until next year nerds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This dc2defcon thing is awesome. Especially seeing there are actual nerds in Congress. Pairs up nicely with what IAEMETC is doing too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>History being made: two sitting congressmen speaking at defcon. JimLangevin & HurdOnTheHill with joshcorman iamthecavalry policynerd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Apparently the defcon Japan delegation brought their own tunes to hackerkaraoke. awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Supervision. And carefully calculated routes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've brought a kid and it was fine. We did not bring him to non-kid friendly things though. Because ewwww.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, classical music training isn't wasted if you're having fun and entertaining people TheSweetKat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scheduling a 10 day work trip with defcon as the middle segment is seeming like less of a good idea with every passing hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are two different sizes. And other things. defcon cDc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're here. And they have stickers. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was great to see you! No worries about doing your job though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor Brent. That 1/4 bottle of actualreverend 's booze did him in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, hackerkaraoke is the only place you can sing alyankovic songs and everybody knows the words. DEFCON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. hackerkaraoke is on. DEFCON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently the way to get cincvolflt really wound up is to ask if there's a 911 app. DEFCON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's fun and addictive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where's your booth at? Made a pass through vendors and couldn't find<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want to hear a huge group of nerds giggle? Use the words "shut down the dark net". DEFCON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Desk guy: have you been to defcon before? Me: first time was 96. Desk guy: *blink* I was born in 96.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just 11 more minutes until the desert makes it's annual attempt to kill me. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do love watching lightning from a plane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently they wouldn't rent it out for evening/night events either. So lame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's easy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do I need to bring to the booth tomorrow to claim my donor swag?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's kinda hot today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We tracked down an Express Driver in a parking lot and he took it! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out the hardest part of this NDPTC trip is trying to drop off our FedEx shipment. Third try, third miss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad you saved it! I used to help, but then politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you need any help? I have my VE card with me! Cc: actualreverend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow we've had a lot of talk of poop in today's ndptc Tools and Techniques course. Thanks SLC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I missed that they were even supposed to be back this year. Guess I'll pay closer attention next year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! I won't be there till tonight, but my tall companion is roaming around there somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! You're here this year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the club! Now go get your VE. Because you can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're having a great time in SLC. But hard to be inside with the beautiful weather! NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is. Will we see you tomorrow??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a collection of our fav videos for the NDPTC SMEM course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Salt Lake City! Happy to be delivering DisasterCTR training today and tomorrow. ndptc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Twitter now the vector for national policy announcements?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm technically on my way to defcon now, with a two-day stop in SLC on my way. Looking forward to seeing old friends and making new ones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To clarify: there is no legal requirement to plan for people shelters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Federal law requires that local jurisdictions plan for pets. There is no legal requirement to plan for people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some pet shelters have room for people though. People will choose to die rather than abandon their pets and we know this and plan for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately, there are legal, hygiene, and health reasons that pets can't stay in people shelters. We try to put pet shelters close by.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spotted at SEA. Check out the Stars and Stripes winglets on this AlaskaAir livery honoring service members. Nicely done! iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Somebody just boarded with a huge boquet of fresh flowers. The entire plane smells like them. Hello allergies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's going to be one crowded cockpit! Two extra pilots aboard! AlaskaAir iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're not going to have a delay I don't think. Just a stall in boarding!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is unusual. Our AlaskaAir flight has a delay in boarding because we're missing a crew member.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the longest upgrade list I've seen on an AlaskaAir flight. 47 people and counting! And first class is checked full.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, my actual burner actually works. Though I think I have an old Blackberry flip phone around here somewhere . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forgot I had this ChesterBe autograph from 2014 linkinpark tour. Was such a pleasure to meet him (and rest of band).#RIPChester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually loved mine for work. Tactile keys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The slightly newer one that is. But not by much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a colleague who still uses one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grrr. I'm going to miss your talk!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread is the best thing about summer camp. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it's a dry heat. Much like your oven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Highly recommend muscle activation therapy. Proformance Rehab in Seattle does it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do not recommend trying to zip your suitcase with your arm in the way. ThatLeftAMark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If everybody who can does just one thing, we can make a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donating my refund to heartsupport and 800273TALK. Hope others do as well. No more lights need to go out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donating value of my refunded linkinpark tickets to heartsupport and 800273TALK Hope others fans do same RIPChester LinkinPark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This linkinpark song. My biggest fear is having someone I know take their life instead of reaching out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll never forget meeting ChesterBe and linkinpark at the Gorge a few years ago. He was genuinely kind and so very talented. RIPChester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really do not want this to be true, but it looks like it is. linkinpark is my fav band and ChesterBe is great front man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don't want this one to be true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbookable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to a brief talk on weaponizing public records requests. This is a big deal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate it when people refer to "them" and "them" is me and I'm sitting in the room!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd go to any, but your new system won't allow me to make reservations and none of your agents can help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I try!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the ChillOut lounge. Calm, quiet, dim. I call it the migraine avoidance room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone who sees it giggles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cats would eat their hats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maiden trip for my new travel buddy too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the new AlaskaAir C concourse lounge! Bright, airy, great view. iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So defcon this year is leg two of a three part work trip. Luckily I found a place to do laundry or leg three would be ugly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole thread. Be the friend somebody can call (or text). It matters. Being a friend is neither an inconvenience or a burden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Washington, well done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My biggest posts ever when I was at the City featured my cat . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Got my eyes checked today. Can finally read again after 4 hours. Now my eyes just ache.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This hold music is some sort of hip Zanfir or something. It confuses me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area emergency management job for a Registered Nurse. Unique skill combo!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I feel like we're living in a mashup of Designated Survivor, House of Cards, and South Park.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dunno, but I got a game worn Stankowski.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes me sad. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad day! Which fire?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seemed like a good song to end the day with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>+ defcon sum: "...most people are benign, some are interesting, some are interesting, some are lovely, and some are viruses with shoes."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now my head hurts and I need ice cream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This day devolved into lots of social media blocking and a police report. creepy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just say no to social media stalkers. In the strongest of terms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interestingly, one of the Tweet trackers I use shows me the blocked person is still tagging me in stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I got to figure out how to block on LinkedIn, after a weirdo who I blocked on Twitter found me there. Go away weirdos ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more question. If I leave it in ticketed form, can I chance the name on of of the tix or does it have to stay the came companion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, when I called, she said I had to wait and talk to Customer Care because of the companion fare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!! You just saved me abou $800. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I cancel a ticket that used a companion fare, do I get the companion cert back to use again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Item 3. WHUT??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweetdeck. Just use Tweetdeck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was supposed to be yesterday and 2 hours before I got a "Oh, we gotta change"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A4: Maybe mute them instead of block them? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sort of lurking around smemchat today. Have a conference call I actually have to pay attention to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the block button. It's good to break out on occasion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not the scba you're looking for . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't give awards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we can't have nice things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in case you didn't already love macklemore. allthefeels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never imagined day would come when I spend half an hour bitching because the cat food dish wouldn't come back online. And yet, here I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just replaced my second monitor with an upgraded one. Now everything is just "off". Monitor arms, tilt, angle. Time for ice cream break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need a robot to feed you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been an owner for nearly 20 years (since they were Fairfield). I knew what I was buying and understood the costs involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah, much more tasty targets for them back there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have an odd year, an even year, and a yearly. Not an issue for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 2.5 hours on hold, I got through to somebody and got my issue resolved. Nothing anybody can do for me now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And another residential fire tap out. Good grief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think they might have run out of fire investigators here in South county tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ridiculous outside right now. Huge booms, flashes, noise. Car of kids flew down our street. Lucky they didn't lose parts on the speed bump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BuzzFeed even asked and gave credit for one they used. The younger generation of the fam was duly impressed. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to take a stroll around the house and make sure nothing is on fire . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it happens, just so weird to have it pop up in my own feed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So strange to see somebody copy your tweet exactly and post it as their own . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh that is not a good call. Eviscerated abdomen from a mortar. Same place kid lost fingers yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Props to 911 dispatchers across the country tonight. Worst day of year to work. Slammed busy, crazed callers, busy responders. longnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I rarely leave home on July 4. Gotta be ready to defend the home from fire. So much stupid out there tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turn on the scanner feed. Crazy busy. All kinds of reserve engines in service, fires, accidents, fights all over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's gonna be a long night . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made guacamole for the first time tonight. It is now dinner. Mmmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry! For a moment I was afraid it was something to do with fireworks. Old age is better, though it doesn't make it easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was yesterday here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brave if that. Either did it daylight or the beam of the security floodlight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not my actual neighbors. I'm wondering if maybe a yard guy accidentally got em, but that makes no sense either. Pieces world still be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went outside to use garden hose. Two of my hoses have had the ends cut off. The missing ends and fittings are nowhere to be found. strange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used parts of my name and added numbers for my second registration and it worked that time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a common name, so that happens to me all the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's fixed now BTW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't checked with any brokerage firms. I noted it on all of the publicly available tickers (Yahoo, Google, NYSE, etc.).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, thought I think I stumbled on a way to search all sizes, but only one property at a time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what happened to me, but I was able to just create a whole new login and it works now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is inventory, but it's REALLY hard to search for things now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to register twice. The first time worked for a week, then dumped me. Had to register again with the new user name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't need an IT ticket. I needed a reservation that had to be done by a person. I can get on the new website fine. Though I hate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 2.5 hours of waiting, somebody answered and helped me. I guess I was one of the lucky ones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so it begins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're probably very excited. Or were. Just in a "need clean pants" kind of way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily it's after hours, with a holiday tomorrow or there would be people jumping off high rises!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a pretty interesting coincidence ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the first news story I've seen:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rounded up. ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It does. It's 123.456, rounded down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here are the correct quotes, direct from the source.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who's screwing with the after-hours stock numbers? Nasdaq shows them correct, but some services reporting bad info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are amazon Microsoft apple and Google stock all showing the same ticker value right now??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Up to 137 minutes of hold time with clubwyndham. Beginning to wonder if anybody actually works there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. 96 minutes of on-hold time and counting with clubwyndham This makes me neither a happy customer or a happy shareholder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Que?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read the thread. Best tweets of the week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same one whose brother got shot week before. Bro going to be ok, but it's been a pretty horrible month at their house. Auntie can't fix!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, tough weekend for a 19 year old. Much sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the reasons I loved AmeriCorps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nephew's epic road trip to EKMuseum with VIP tix to grand opening ended in fail after buddy crashed bike. Now in WY, never made KS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little bummed that "Michael" from "Microsoft" hung up on me before we got to the good parts of the "alerts that my computer was sending".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Headache, day 9. fml<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It goes in the bucket of fail. Which is full due to a flying spaghetti monster incident that happened overnight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A forest of glow in the dark fail!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This project has thus far been a whole lot of fail. At least it's cool looking fail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And because this was clearly a lesson observed and NOT a lesson learned, I found an outlet that is not controlled by a switch. take4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's important lesson: the 3D printer is plugged into an outlet that's controlled by the light switch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lawyers, asking for SSNs via non-secured website. I pointed out many ways that could go wrong for them. Asked for PII policy. crickets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After holding for an hour, clubwyndham says "oh, system outage. Call back next week". Ever heard of a service status message? fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Current hold times with clubwyndham "more than 60 minutes" and have been that way for almost 40 minutes. Maybe add some staff??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The roofer is loudly singing American Pie from the top of my roof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fidget spinner. Or cat toy. Or tree ornament. It was just an amusing test print. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just gonna go out on a limb here and say the calibration is off slightly. It's a 20mm cube . . . 3dprinting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3D printer is back in service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lesson learned: ignore all the complicated BS instructions for clearing a 3D printer clog and just jam a paperclip through it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That seems like a horrible idea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mechanical pencil has disappeared. Thankfully, there is Amazon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not the scba you're looking for . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bugger. Going to miss the home opener and the hanging of the banner. Will have to find someone worthy of our seats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adjunct instructor of Homeland Security, for someone with a Master's degree in a related field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited to see SeattleTbirds alum cpickard1, kkolesar28, and stheodore17 all on GoldenKnights roster. Gotta go to at least one game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bird got down chimney and into the house during today's construction. Only noticed by the 20 pound cat. In the server room. Nothing broke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I realized today that people on those 3-wheeled motorcycles look ridiculous when they try to weave through traffic and be jerks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working from home during a reroofing project was not a great idea. I think all the demo work is done now, so maybe the house won't shake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That looks lovely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Symphony for a whole lotta lights and sirens" seems to be playing in our city tonight. Sure sign that summer is here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live in the PNW. We consider all sunlight to be a weapon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My NHL jersey record is intact. I buy a jersey, player gets traded (or picked) away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's about how long it usually takes to bring on the new FEMA admin. His hearings were a couple of weeks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh Navient customer service. I asked a question. They sent me instructions to do the exact thing I told them I did NOT want to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brock Long (soon to be BrockatFEMA) is the new FEMA admin. He's already been confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've tried to swap. Always ends with "Crap, I didn't bring X, it's in my other bag".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I'm a one and done for a small bag. It goes everywhere, everyday, including disaster deploys. Is why the waist strap would be nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One reason I got the Covrt was the laptop pocket. And Rush 24 was too large. If I replace, it will be with Havoc 30. It has waist strap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! Mine spends a lot of time there too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 511Tactical Covrt18 is my everyday backpack. Only time it's an issue is if I have to guide TSA through emptying all 22 pockets ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reserving excitement until I see your picks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not certain what my current script is, so can't really answer that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp, my vision is too good for Lasix. Guess it's another 40 years of glasses . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The roof work caused my upstairs smoke detector to detach from the ceiling, hurl itself down the stairs, and send batteries flying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anytime somebody apologizes for lack of tech knowledge when I'm helping them, I point out I taught dad to upload blog photos via flip phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting thing is that both parties did something illegal. Their insurance companies are going to have a field day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, not really any points for blocking in this scenario!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mission accomplished?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's right up there with going to the grocery store.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know who's cool in Vegas? the GoldenKnights<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not that one. Time ran out. Have to start all over. This new master's will contribute toward it though if I do start over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public Administration. And the doctorate I didn't quite finish was same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second master's but the only people counting are the one who take my money. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm spending no small amount of time at khanacademy remembering how to math.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point. It's 100% online. I'm not moving to a non-WHL city! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fairly excited, and slightly apprehensive, that I was accepted into the MS in Analytics program at GeorgiaTech. I start in January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My annual trek to defcon has become the middle of an extended work trip. I'd say I don't know how this happened, but I do. I like money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got a couple of complicated things to deal with. I'll message you and see if you can take care of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Been trying to call AlaskaAir all day. Keep having to give up due to long hold times. 4th try now ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem with amazon order. Called them, spoke with a real human, who fixed it. Yay!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fav volunteer event is coming up: SKC Clinic. Come help us provide free medical care to ~4000 people in 4 days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we have circles now. Didn't that fix everything??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They all use the same naming convention though, by brand. And reality is even a half brained thief will do factory reset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facebook generally down res's photos and strips x data though. Ditto Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here to. Best bet wasn't good bet! I'll cruise through the info on my Nikon photos and see if there's a unique searchable thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assuming you reported it stolen, best bet is to spam pawn shops with info. Not a lot of useful metadata for that purpose in a camera<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have the serial number?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF is that???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't we just leave it at "Don't sell spyware"? No government has shown themselves capable of handing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool private sector EM related job for a GIS person. With ESRI in California.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working from home will be interesting this week. House reroof underway. Before I even have my first cup of coffee. noisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My vague tweet from the other night. Young relative sent home with this. Yay for going home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrorism among other things. For the past 15 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had 2 in US in last couple weeks, that govt & media are essentially refusing to call out as terrorism. Both were committed by white guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrorism isn't limited to politics. Nearly every definition includes social objectives as well. And nobody has to claim responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's still grillin' to do!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is it's not yet 9 PM out here on the best coast yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Called my dad for Father's Day. Now being regaled with chicken stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>City of SeaTac is looking for a GIS specialist to do Emergency Management stuff. 18 month position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is also where family emergencies get complicated. Convos via Signal, Messenger, Snapchat , text, voice. Platform for each generation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not tonight. I'm not in a mood to stay disengaged. Nor do I have the fortitude to engage in troll battle tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2. I don't ever buy the "accidental" shooting excuse. It's always a stupid/careless/reckless/negligent act. No room for accident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/2. I really, really want to tweet about something right now, but I can't deal with the ensuing trolls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Streudal is a go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For one day, we're weirder than Portland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You really should. Now I want to know what's on it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy putting on his coat just grazed my head with a fist. Split second later and I'd probably have a shiner . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I'm trying to decide if there's room for streudal. I'm pretty sure there is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. That's a great way to do it! Where do you drop it off??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dinner was photo worthy. FoodOfMyPeople<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am my father's daughter. Doors are always locked. Which has lead me to have to "phone a friend" to get in more than once!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does it count that my doors in WA are locked 24/7, unless I'm using them?? I'm in Oregon tonight and hotel doors lock automatically!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what did I just get signed up for??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I got a Twitter app update today. Not sure I actually like it. Makes my eyes trip for some reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's clearly an expectation here I want aware of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found the sun!! It's in Portland . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm floored that people send insult messages upon being rejected. Apparently they never, ever want to be considered in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made a grumpy tweet about it a while back. No response from Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been there for a while. I set it up, assuming I could kill the SMS one. No joy. So dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talking cyber. Student: "We upload pictures of David Hasselhoff if someone leaves something open - we call it getting "Hoff'ed" " awesome<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nope! I'm home, in the land of grey. Next con for me is Party In The Desert con.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent last week w/person who kept referring to things from the 60s, clearly believing that a) I was alive then and b) old enuf to remember.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I really dislike Junuary. So cold today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out issue with gsuite is their piss poor documentation. After a week of battle, finally got somebody to say "oh, that doesn't work"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey Avis, I returned a car almost 24 hours ago. Still shows as active rental in the app and no receipt available. What gives??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday, airboat ride in Florida. Today, ferry ride on Puget Sound to Vashon for a disaster exercise. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for bringing me home safely once again AlaskaAir! home iflyalaska<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our house is made with lathe and plaster inside. It essentially is a Faraday cage. Can be very annoying!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you look really close, you can see the plane that took off right before us. seatac twilight IFlyAlaska teampixel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why iflyalaska. Just before we left, CSA runs on plane, gives prev yelling guy printout info to get the refund he wants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delay reason now clear. Waited for a late connection so people could get on this plane. Better than waiting 12 hours. I'm good with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. Now the previously yelling guy and his new friend are talking about the demise of society due to social media. If they only knew . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. Now we've popped a delay for unknown reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, not this one. I've had some doozies! A crazy lady who kept making calls on her flip phone the whole flight. And she talked to "somebody"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now it turns out they're not quite in the right seat. Guy in the aisle is supposed to be window. He's letting them stay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now he's complaining because he has more leg room but less butt room. Which is true. Bulkhead exit row.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He left his wife behind as insurance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, he's back already. He wanted a refund because his premium seat wasn't premium enough. Apparently he didn't get one. givehimbooze<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She fixed it in her own way! Very effectively in fact. Gave him two choices: yell at gate agent here or in Orlando. He chose here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy has now voluntarily left the plane to go yell at the gate agent. He's in my fav non-upgraded seat and should probably STFU. iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh oh. Guy in the plane is yelling at the flight attendant because his premium seat doesn't have more leg room. iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two things that go great together! iflyalaska in fuzzy flywithFi socks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re: yesterday's smemchat discussion on rumors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no. Not again. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I will incorporate this into all infosec related policies I develop. It's possibly the most important thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe they really want to pawn subj off on somebody else urgently??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, and it has to be very level!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I discovered that sometimes FB will think you're filming vertically when you're not. Annoying. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got them from Tarantino4me. He reads nerdy stuff like that. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A7 Trick with live video is to go on long enough to build an audience. I think the latest stats said 15-20 minutes is ideal. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had that sign in our office!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always talk about prioritizing. Those that impact ops, life safety, etc. get addressed. Those that don't, might not. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. But State put out call for vols on Friday, then went home for weekend. Legit call, but poorly worded. Much confuse. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use it as a case study in what not to ever, ever do. Was not our lane or our issue, but got dumped in the lap of the meager JIC. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people were answering an ill-announced call for vols. They were not "spontaneous" in the typical sense. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A5. This is one of those areas where I wish Twitter would step up with a reporting mechanism and intervene. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A5. ugh. I've had Tweets fights with them. To no avail. I think quoted tweet with "BAD INFO" or something is only solution. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody understood the info about the call for vols and our areas got inundated with people who wanted to help. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We did a lot of rumor stuff on the 2015 wildfire. Most of them we had to acknowledge in order to correct. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A4, I think that's a pretty good list for consumers. If we're doing monitoring though, we sometimes have to dig deeper. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A3 I actually have a certain appreciation for media passing along rumors since than I can find easily and confirm or debunk. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A3. Also, related to that article, there's a big difference in what we do vs what journalists do. We debunk rumors. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A3 Have dealt with "dam is going to fail" many times. Always do preemptive rumor control on that. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A3. Depends entirely on the rumor, how significant it is, how likely to go viral. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2. MaryJoFly did a great job of addressing rumors during the Oroville Dam thing. Live stream from EOC. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW, I've missed you all! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all fairness, that's because some of us troll the fema camp hashtag. For funs. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I come from a very strange family. Both parents volunteer ff/EMTs. Our dinner convos were normal to us. Not so much to others. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. I'll have to Google that ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was less immediate and less volume. I spent my formative years looking for lost people in the wilderness. Strange things happen there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. That was more or less my comment that started this thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if nothing else, it could eliminate clear duplicates. There's some great potential there to both speed things up and reduce noise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the "sometimes" part. There's no normal response to any of this, for anybody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes even worse, since you might have to view it more than once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting concept. I'm having a convo next week with an engr about machine learning in EM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not just public sector. Plenty of NGO and private sector charged with monitoring as well. Also, 100% agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I recall you talking about that. Just so disheartening. Jokes, accusations, misinformation. And dead kids in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so many people just being aweful to fellow human beings. Nauseating. Sometimes think SM was worst thing ever created.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why do you keep tagging me in your posts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait to see it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In true PNW fashion, hardly any umbrellas out here in the rain. Waiting on the SeattleTbirds WHLChampions to arrive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We see you up there KIRO7Seattle helicopter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Party can start. CoolBird has arrived at ShoWareCenter. And there seems to be a news chopper overhead. WHLChampions SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At ShoWareCenter with many others. Looks like they even opened the doors so people can use the bathroom. Waiting on SeattleTbirds champs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And more on the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've listened to ThomBeuning's radio call of the winning goal several times now. Still not tired of it. RaiseTheRoof WHLChampions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody was talking about that at Celtic last night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, this. WHLCHampions SeattleTbirds Goosbumps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh, thanks Swype keyboard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My twitter frustration: 2FA requires SMS, even if code generator is active. Support this is not ok. SMS=insecure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent most of the last two hours installing patches. HappyMonday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy cow. This has to be the best team we've ever iced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeesh. Luckily SeattleTbirds brings a large and enthusiastic fan base with them! LetsGoBirds WinTheCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I tweeted enough hockey tonight that Twitter thinks I should want to follow every football account out there. Um, ok, no. And<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5ish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now I'm just really hoping that the first SeattleTbirds home game of next season isn't until October. Don't want to miss the awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had one streaming from Celtic Club, but Periscope ate it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should be noted that I've never changed my profile pic until tonight. Now I'm afraid to change it until MemorialCup is over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want to hear ThomBeuning's radio call for that final SeattleTbirds goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just worried now about when opening night will be. Don't want to miss it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody told me tonight that if you stay on the US side, plenty of cheap rooms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the MemorialCup features 2 US teams and 2 Canadian teams. That doesn't happen very often! letsgobirds winthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have the app. But I was busy!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle wins!!! seattletbirds whlchampionship BroughtItHome wonthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope the bar has an AED. This game!! letsgobirds bringithome WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downside of the Celtic Club tonight: still no food. hungry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They seem to have trouble staying in their feet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nooooooooooooooooooooo. We've seen the replay 100 times. Should not have been major.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's worked out just fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Celtic Club crew has watched the pre-game video, yelled to Rock and Roll part 2 and is ready for hockey. bringithome WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey LrednaxelA thanks for being my 2000th follower!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to go to bed, but this: lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We saw you! Now we know who you are. Glad you enjoyed your time here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's too bad TheWHL doesn't have video of Turner_Otto2 winking at WHLPats bench. Hockey gold right there! BringItHome WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. Just logged in to my voicemail on my phone. 109 messages. It transcribes them all, so I guess I've never logged in to delete them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We switched to projectfi to get them. Camera is amazing. Fingerprint scanner is more handy than I ever thought it would be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I so love mine, though I didn't not buy the most expensive one. It's definitely the best phone I've ever had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are so going to miss this team next year. letsgobirds winthecup WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So did the SeattleTbirds lose a bunch of billets? Never seen this much bullet recruiting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We yell at those people in our section. Or jab then with these clapper things, as was the case tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Just wow. That was a great period of hockey. LetsGoBirds WinTheCup WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may be the loudest game I've been to ShoWareCenter. Can barely hear realmofhelm sometimes! letsgobirds winthecup WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's clearly a very winning area to sit in though. If you guys win 50/50 over there I'm unfollowing you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The floor by my seat is soooooo sticky. What could have happened here in the past 48 hours??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So excited! It's a very rare thing for the last game of the season to actually be the last possible one. If that makes any sense . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was hoping that my back would quit hurting before time to leave for hockey, but I guess not. Hopefully so much excitement I forget pain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some industry still runs software that's never been optimized for the modern Windows experience. Boggles the mind . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprised at how many I still see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And nuke any remaining XP boxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, he is somebody's child, so yes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new jersey! Definite game wear. :) letsgobirds winthecup WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. Hockey people! My SeattleTbirds CarlStankowski jersey is ready for pickup. And it's white!! letsgobirds winthecup WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also: quit using Windows XP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just rolled out a Cyber Incident Annex to my 16 cities yesterday. Happy to share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief. Somebody just texted me a photo of a tenant account list for an apartment complex. Now they asked me to delete it. wrongnumber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And don't forget the times they showed up for the occasional game in Seattle. They were hard to miss and we were always very impressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Former job forbid employees from checking laptops for that reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When somebody steals your laptop from your checked bag, huge potential for info compromise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been on it since before the playoffs though I think. So hopefully I'm near the top somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*snort*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine's a Sanvido, so that particular mojo has left the building. I'm on the list for a Stanwowski though ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really need to wash my white jersey, but I'm holding out ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LinkinPark, tea, and grading. I really know how to party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were driving somewhere the other night and my hubby was inventorying the types of cat hair on his shirt. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the cat hair scattered across the shirt, not just on the cat. This is me every day. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, the solution to bombs that have happened once is to create additional fire hazards and increased data theft?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How odd. Guy behind me knew EVERYTHING about hockey last night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yeah. Regina is melting down. This is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were soooo good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except it's not Brown now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The loudmouth next to me says you're pretty ok too RealmofHelm. (I'm married to said loudmouth. . . )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How could you even get it to fit???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if they need a new name, it would be the Regina Rage then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just leaned clear over him and looked at his screen. He didn't notice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the man-bunned dude in the skinny hipster suit with the fancy camera is mildly annoying too. Mostly because he's taking crowd pix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Make the guys behind me stop talking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Achy ears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine too. Have new linkinpark pre-ordered on vinyl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmmmm. Records.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If course you do! Forgot my audience for a second there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is one more reason to avoid country music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's from Regina, so maybe he just made that call himself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much squealing out there for me right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I missed goal 2 because I was watching replay of goal 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switzerland baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll try to make up for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's JonRyan9 in the SeattleTbirds house for the puck drop! letsgobirds winthecup WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're gonna relay the important parts, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CRUNCH. crunch. crunch. crunch. CRUNCH. crunch. crunch. crunch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting in a meeting, next to someone who thought eating a nice crunchy apple was an appropriate level of professionalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huge fight in the smoking area as we were driving out. Hard to tell how many actually fighting, but people were down and hurt. Many cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya know SeattleTbirds, if you want fans to behave, make sure your game night staff are setting the example. Kid w/ID screaming at refs. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were Keystone cops on that pp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have know people with cupcakes! (@jamsknit1 )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I generally just hide in my seat on Tuesdays, watching for beervalanches to cascade by me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worst thing I've seen tonight: very hairy buttcrack of the guy sitting next to us when he got up and left. pullyourpantsup cannotunsee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least Leedahl hasn't bitten anybody tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, Weds totally got away with clocking some guy in the head as they headed to the benches earlier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note at whl is some poor random dude. You were looking for TheWHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a hard pass. LetsGoBirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serious question. What's the rocker patch on the arm of the WHLPats jerseys (with all the letters) stand for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the new highlight video! Best parts: 1) me and my hockey neighbors, 2) the illegal flag! LetsGoBirds winthecup WHLChampionship<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He's 17 now technically. I know that's 16 in hockey years though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm following the SeattleTbirds game via Twitter from Anchorage. letsgobirds winthecup WHLPlayoffs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>HOLY LIGHTNING!!!!!!! Ok, that one was huge and close. Heard the crack. And cats are running for cover. wawx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>ICYMI Facebook now allows Pages to Manage Groups. NDPTC SMEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking of partnerships, the TEEX guy just hauled my box back to our NDPTC classroom. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good morning New Jersey! Excited to be in Atlantic City for the first time to deliver some smem goodness for ndptc with WxKyleNelson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know he says his opinions are his own, but he's the comms guy for thewhl. Our team won. The officiating was awful. WHLPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Major Junior Hockey in the US is pretty full of insults too. Though in Seattle we just yell everybody sucks. The default is "portland sucks"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, playoff hockey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hilariously, never dawned on me what your name was reference to until I saw the shirt. I'm sure the lightbulb came on over my head!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously thought he was going to put somebody through the boards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was indeed a derpy play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Air is blowing like crazy in our seats. Though not as cold as it should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, but almost doesn't matter at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The guy who keeps spilling his beer behind me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially since Kelowna was the most heavily penalized in the regular season. Apparently they became angels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you were over here in our section, it would just blend in with the beer everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair, that was the off ice crew. They'd never trust the refs to push the buttons and turn the knobs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the second beer waterfall of the night has run under me. Seriously people. Hold your beer or get a sippy cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the biggest officiating goat rope I've ever seen. On and off ice. TheWHL you really need to fix this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why fans throw things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From the Can't Make This Stuff Up file.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sometimes you can though. Known threats in known areas. Dam failures, lahars, flash flood in certain waterway. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then you interact with a fed, where all thumbdrives are banned. No simple solution, except multiple formats. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Business needs followers for long-term brand marketing. SMEM needs engagement and immediate action usually. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think some sort of script for known hazards is important, especially if short-notice. Lahars, flash floods, etc. come to mind. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahah! You said CD. I have no computers with optical drives. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely different mindset. Same basic core, but different audience and intended outcomes. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, there's just the one official one and I don't recommend it, unless you've never seen SM before. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typically, the work of government continues during a shutdown, but employees don't get paid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 if you count IS-42. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never used Tags. But it's literally this easy. Free version lets you do one search. Paid is unlimited. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope so! Given his engagement in EM Tech things, I would think he might. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweetdeck or Hootsuite are really the only way for Twitter. No password sharing required. Moot point on FB. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweet Archiver, an add-on for Google Sheets. Gathers metadata. And Tweepsmap. Helps me spot bots and dead accounts. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Internal folks seem quite happy with it too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: I use tools that show me the stats of accounts that interact with me. One tool shows me metadata. One shows "last active". smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen a lot of whining about this. I would never choose "first concert" as a security question because I don't know the answer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes it feels like they're all Monday ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit. This is my alma mater. These are my students. I hope the catch the anonymous person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, duh! If I must participate, I drop my bomb, then set the post to no longer follow so I don't get any of the notifications. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Her expressions were so, ... expressive! And that finger wag. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. That was hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no. RIP Officer Grant. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just post one a day, as a run up to summer! disasterdrinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way to be a Debbie Downer!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's definitely playoff hockey time. Watching 2 NHL games and listening to a WHL game. playoff hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Online radio broadcast is about a minute delayed. Going to have to stay off Twitter during this SeattleTbirds game. spoilers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Noooooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't misunderstand. I have Center Ice and watch every channel with hockey. Much prefer NHLNetwork. Now I'll never see ESPN again though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, what? Hockey was literally the only reason I ever watched espn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally got to somebody on the technical assistance team who 1) acknowledged that there is a problem; 2) Explained how it's being fixed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that is exactly the issue. I gave it to BarclaycardUS since they denied having a problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I had not seen that and nobody has followed up on my trouble ticket in a week ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why horrid customer service? I'm stuck in some vortex between BarclaycardUS, QuickBooks, & quicken. Each blames another. Nobody fixing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was earlier today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! I'm trying to track it all. the data nerd in me wants ALL THE NUMBERS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Cancelling a SIRIUSXM account is one of the most complicated things on the planet. NotHelpful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true. And really, any that go down the "let me scare you" road are pretty useless to the non-tech crowd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No explanation needed ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. That was the most awkward microsoft Usability study qualification interview ever! Either bad questions or bad interviewer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best will be him coming to initially, totally confused, and dropping an F-bomb on the floor of first class (where his wife dragged him).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too! It's ripe for family jokes for years since he's fine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was definitely my most exciting moment on a plane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big kudos to flight crew on AlaskaAir 726 and the ponytailed Dr. Chris from row 19 . My brother passed out. He's fine. They're awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's a big cat. Gave up trying to tell him what to do. Though he can't be up there when we're eating. Usually sits on extra chair, staring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>+100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While I was out of town, my house cleaner sent me a selfie with my cat. Cat was on the dining room table. lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our AlaskaAir pilot is a total numbers nerd. He just gave us every imaginable stat for our trip from IAD to SEA. nerdpower iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's where we were too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I claimed specially that the 5 I'm affiliated with placed no such limits in their contacts. 5 is not the same as all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made no such statement. I asked for evidence that they are placing limits, as it's very concerning to me and I want to know which ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can say with certainty that none of my contracts contain such a limitation. I'm not attacking. I'm asking for evidence of your claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Policies are rarely posted in the public domain. They're on intranets and in employee manuals. Which is why search waits until tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet you've claimed multiple times today that the limits are on place. Now you're saying you have no evidence to back that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll have to look tomorrow to see which are publicly available. Please post links to contacts that limit/prohibit free speech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. I have copies of university policies that encourage free speech. I'm not minimizing. I asked a legit question that you didn't answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could totally see doing virtual marches in MMORPGs though! They have weddings and funerals, so why not marches??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have examples of this? I teach for 5 different ones and all encourage free speech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right?? Hotel pool in my near future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, but there are. Vendors in the middle of march selling all sorts of loot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR, I'm now questing for dry socks . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Questing for Science!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Brother: I'm impressed that everything I've wanted, you've produced from your magic backpack (as he stirs coconutmilk creamer in his coffee)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're a miracle. Sometimes my brain doesn't register that I have a migraine though, so I don't take them right away. derpybrain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the light went off and they're on board!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My meds will kill mine in 20 minutes. So thankful for triptans! I just need 60 seconds of seatbelt light off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad headache. Much turbulence. Headache meds in bag above my head. Can't get. Ugh.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anybody else I know going to ScienceMarchDC this weekend?? ScienceMarch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's total shame to have a full 6-pack. Beer is made for sharing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gives a whole new meaning to pants on fire, huh?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of my GU students works for Newport, so that's a sure possibility!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should just "borrow" California's material! No sense reinventing the wheel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta say, I like the current one better. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[supposed to be grading papers. Spending too much time on Twitter]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it is a bonafide work of art, worthy of liking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. What's the point of the class if they don't actually teach that part??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The resilience of it was evident after the Nepal earthquake. It's why Standby Task Force was so busy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was a 911 dispatcher before there was CAD. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also think there's a case for learning the system, then using tech to implement it locally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to know. The EMAT has been talking about it and I've been pushing back since we ARE a deployable asset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I disagree with using non-recognized training, at least for people who intend to deploy. But there isn't anything else, so ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Requiring EOC people to take field-based ICS Position Specific classes is just plain silly. But we don't have anything else, so .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, yes we do. And it was in the works, but then the director of the NIC got a new job and hasn't been replaced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PSC isn't an EOC course though. I'ts a CP course. Hence Tcards FTW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, well, all -hazards is just wildfire in a different wrapper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except it requires power. These were designed for wildfires, which often are very low tech. And firefighters are often very low tech too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope they do. This started with missing transactions. they "fixed it" and half my stuff vaporized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a ticket open with support. This is really, really bad. App has info web doesn't. Web missing $9k worth of data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's a double at that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely. QuickBooks self-employed just wiped out half of my expenses for the year. Thankfully I keep backups. Tho in Quicken, so see prev.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>65 minute with Quicken support and case finally escalated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now at 60 minutes with Quicken support. Mostly with me say "Yeah, I already did that" or just silence and "please bear with me" from them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quicken: I'm trying to check if we could escalate your case. Me: um, if you can't fix it, you better. That's the whole point of support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>31 minutes with Quicken support so far and we've gotten nowhere. ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funniest thing I've seen all day! Making this painful Quicken support interaction much more bearable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deal with the IRS phone tree was easier than dealing with Quicken support ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I loved that job. A lot. Downside was working weekends and holidays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would probably be more helpful on coworkers. Callers don't listen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't quite work like that! Did that job for 13 years . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The weather station is finally off the Windows box and on the Weatherbridge. It was complicated by an adorable kitty unplugging a computer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But did they make sure to tell the flag police??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used my car to stop traffic for some of the ugliest goslings I've ever seen. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my favorite:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, it's spring in the PNW, where everyone is wiling to stop and assist baby critters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't even come close to parsing that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! Never miss it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck with that. They have extremely limited availability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'll have to talk to the POC about that. We just take who they let in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We reportedly have 40 people registered for each one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed we are! Teaching NDPTC PER304 and PER344. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These appeared back to back in my feed. I don't think mdeyerin and RealmofHelm know each other, but clearly they have things in common.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's possible I might miss the entire third round of the SeattleTbirds WHLPlayoffs. Only get to see a game if it goes past 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, for use as a noisemaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best and worst moment in hockey. letsgobirds winthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been loose for a while!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They need to make these things sturdier for playoffs. letsgobirds winthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's right behind my head. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's stinky though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the wambulance has pulled up outside. Must be WHLsilvertips ride home. letsgobirds winthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably from Everett<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realized that doofus is chewing and spitting in a Coke bottle. So gross. I thought tobacco wasn't allowed in ShoWareCenter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a boldmove there WHLsilvertips . pulledthegoalie with 10 minutes left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And pdxwinterhawks are done. letsgobirds winthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Portland is half a period away from being eliminated. letsgobirds winthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where did this come from??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crowd Management seems overly anxious at Showare tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it the same guy they showed on the big screen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They seriously just showed a broom on the screen. That's horrible luck!!! Bad form Showare! letsgobirds winthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won the argument last year by pointing out that I expected them to take everything off the rails. There was a lot, everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the flag is on the railing. Last year we were told absolutely nothing allowed on the railing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Long anthems Sundays only, regular season only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weneedlesscowbell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trolling. That's trolling, not trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doofuses didn't even bother to stand for the goal. Maybe from Everett . . . Trying to commence in 3, 2, 1 . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. Now the doofuses (doofusi?) are literally talking about hookers, blow, and underages . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hereby complain about every cowbell. Please confiscate them all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Doofus behind me: "Try to get a penalty" "Try to get in a fight" "Try to score a goal"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enthusiastic Grandma is back tonight! We'll be listening to her yell for Grope and Nools, but she does love hockey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even Everett let a Seattle flag in the barn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anthems that last a full period should be reserved for Sunday games during regular season. Don't care how good you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, tyler_thomas12 this was for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tyler's pre-game monologue was excellent! letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok SeattleTbirds, it's game 4. You got this! letsgobirds winthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I emailed you a potential job lead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lesson of the week: "Hi, we're from the government and we're here to be p0wned". cybersecurity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I couldn't find a way to do shared attribution though. I ended up putting t in projects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed! I'd also like to see LinkedIn add a presentations section. It has Publications, but not Presentations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question! We can share it via LInkedIn and list us both there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. IRSnews actually answered my question, but I'm missing a form. And apparently today is a bank holiday. so can't get it. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, yes I do. been 30 minutes now. Luckily I'm at my desk, with a charger, and get other work done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of the idea is to learn to make short posts! pst314<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't found one I like for my phone. I'm just using native Twitter app for Android.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely. Got home to a notice of deficiency from the IRSnews for 2015. It's wrong. I'll now spend the next 5 hours on hold, to ask them WTF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One solitary united flight attendant on the SeaTacAirport train. Big dark glasses, looking at her feet, willing the world not to see her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the lovely look of home! iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wowsers! I guess common sense can be popular. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And therobdale is a friend. Now famous apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok Twitter, let's say I do like documentaries. How does that lead you to believe I will like transformers? PleaseExplain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! But also gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got lucky this morning. Accidentally set my 0430 alarm to buzz instead of beep. Woke up anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally just pointed mine to LinkedIn profile. Because meh. On the upside, Word Press routinely let's me knows it's updated itself . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmmmm. Brownies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And do you also believe in jraphics?? (Not to be confused giraffes. Or pregnant giraffes)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a Graphics Interface Format, soooooo . . . GSMCon2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. Now I'm following another cat on Twitter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to kick off our presentation on drones and social at GSMCon2017 with MaryJoFly. Prepare to be nerded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>660. Just came up delayed, but I already knew! Watched the inbound arrive. Comfy seat. Plenty of drinks. itsallgood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It comes with a warning pinned at the top, since prior are likely to be confused by the lack of theme!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is handy. My seat at the AlaskaAir lounge has a direct view of my gate. I can say with certainty that we're not boarding in time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do. I call it Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently the hubby decided the easiest way to remove the giant old TV from the attic was in pieces. nerdlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeesh. SeaTacAirport is a zoo tonight. Heavy traffic, much construction, closed checkpoints, people everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you still going to be there tomorrow night?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that SeattleTbirds have 18 guys on the scoresheet in the playoffs already, and it includes the goaltender! letsgobirds winthecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uhhhhhhhhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of us ARE NHL fans. They just won't give us a team in the modern era. We did win the Stanley Cup in 1917, so we've got 100 years of exp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe you can convince WxKyleNelson to go next year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is that all sorts of malicious things can lurk behind a QR code. GSMCon2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I love my friends. coffeescouts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fly all night tonite. Arrive DFW at 0500. Acquire coffee. Speak on drones and social at 0915 for GSMCon2017 w/@MaryJoFly. longday funday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New season of Deadliest Catch started last night. They were even talking about it, though not by name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My travel coffee is restocked for a while . . . coffee travel yum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh thank God! Did not have time for real OT tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get the job done quick. letsgobirds othockey playoffhockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, now we panic. We've never lost to Everett though when we've scored first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, no panic. No time for panic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Refs. The invisible hook leads to a goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he tried to go in the wrong box. Because he never goes there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, Iverson. I almost forgot. refyousuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best trike race song ever! dragula<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got myself on the list for a SeattleTbirds CarlStankowski game worn jersey tonight. Hope he sticks around for a while! letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, but usually they call them matching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was so deserving of "splish splash, I was takin' a bath"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was a mini-rant in our house when that came out. It involved a lot of WTF??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did that guy turn into such a jerk??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to meeting everybody at GSMCon2017 on Thursday, when MaryJoFly and I talk drones and Social Media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll take a look at that. I hate it when they roll out new features and don't say anything ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I taught a class once (week long) where a guy in the class wore a hat that said "that guy". It was so, so fitting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Negative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new Twitter mobile "feature" of not being able to remove someone from a convo is annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More wierd: 1) cop was wearing jeans. 2) guy got back on the plane. Guessing more to story, but not much could justify that use of force.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Mult eyewitness pics and vids, including close-ups of the blood. And United has acknowledged it, with a note about re-accommodation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Another reminder of why I'll never fly united. All because they screwed up and let too many paying customers on the plane?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why it took so long!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our class bling finally arrived! Great memories with a great group of people at FEMA_EMI leadership emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn straight! letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to actually meet you jamsknit1!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was that song "I like is better when we're wasted" at a youth hockey game???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never once had one spilled on me there when I had season tix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got more beer spilled on me when we were Everett season tix holders than everywhere else we've been combined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok SeattleTbirds fans. Next period, we troll Hart. letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm gonna lose my voice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I'm going to give a little credit for "can't keep my hands to myself" to accompany the holding call. thatsfunnyrightthere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The clear implication here is that it is a radio controlled system and this was an over-the-air hack. Secure your radio systems. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also realizing how lucky we are to have RealmofHelm behind the mic and the tunes at ShoWareCenter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's slightly to my right. Agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure the actual biggest group of the night in Everett is SeattleTbirds fans. letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sound they play after an WHLsilvertips goal sounds like a in severe gastrointestinal distress. letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woooooooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's only $5.29 for US. Still a ripoff. Pretty sure we could Periscope them with better quality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hockey tweets forthcoming. First time in the WHLsilvertips barn in a long time. We were inagural season tix holders tho. Now, letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all fairness, my sis uses a flip phone . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Introduced my 12 yr old niece to 2FA today. She thought it made perfect sense. Her mom (my sis) looked at me like I was maybe a sorceress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh good grief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many government systems are vulnerable. "Why would anybody want to hack that" isn't a great defense. cybersecurity emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In do like that you can walk all the way around too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do they still have the mini donuts??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now a small child SCREAMING. My super awesome noise cancelling headphones aren't able to keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been a long time since I sat in a middle seat between two strangers. I don't like it. Only doing it to get home 3+ hours sooner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess this flight is going to be spent engrossed in my coursera data science math skills class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I can send you an email when I'm not crammed between two giant dudes on a plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Non responsive buttons. Tried to modify, couldn't choose my destination. Cancelled it. Tried to book new. "Let's go" button wouldn't click.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got it to work via the mobile web interface. App is no bueno.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. WingzTeam your app not working. Trying to modify a ride. Can't. Cancelled it. Trying to book new one. Can't. Will try again in-flight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've been to this store. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Noted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes to handle, no to QR code. I just carry a sharpie so I can add the first and destroy the second as needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dispatcher ears . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I'll take that as my hint to get my stuff finished!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm looking forward to it too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a really phenomenal story. One person can make a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bummer. I really liked it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Phones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waitress at hotel informed me "all the pedophiles move to Alaska". I was like "uhhhhhh". All I could come up with was "not all of them".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you still make this pen or refills for it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Student just explained the exercise design process using dating as an example. It was brilliant! emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Just no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On an EMAC deployment or something??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey N4JSU, good job on the news! Glad nobody was hurt in your county today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess that makes us co-workers now! That's kinda cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that. I had a lady doing that on a speaker phone. I always take it as a challenge to make them want to hang up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's dead Jim. Yes, I carry spares. pen preparedness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of friends and family in this big red blob. Stay safe today people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to use the trollbegone button there for a second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super bro dudes just sat down at the bar. Guessing they're sales bro dudes. ugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dinner??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>West coast here. Could we just not declare war on North Korea? I'd prefer that the West coast remain intact. diplomacy not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, a person I don't care about pimping a product I don't like. movingon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly I've missed something Pepsi related today. I'm afraid to go look . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I've had season tix to all three!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|><----- technerd policywonk This is the thing I live for!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought they just played hockey there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I liked calling prior Eggheads. Guess I'll go with Graylings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, if they practiced good infosec, they disabled his codes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. I hope no plane I ever fly in has to do anything like these moves!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully this leaves room for more of our TheWHL and USHL superstars. hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An excellent case study of SMEM and unintended consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Iowa! Excited to be teaching Basic Academy Train-the-Trainer here today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally landed. No ground crew available to park our plane. Also no Uber or Lyft available. *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Officially rooting for victoriaroyals tonight. Regardless of who wins though, both goalies deserve first star. WHLPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a good thing it was an afternoon game though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it goes another OT, those jerseys can probably play on their own. gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Epic hockey battle in Victoria tonight. 4th OT underway. Survivor of the series plays Seattle. This is great news for Seattle!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sticker has been applied, the logbook is being signed, and we're about to go. Finally!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pilot: somebody tried to open rear emer exit while it was armed. Have to get that checked B4 we go to make sure tail cone doesn't fall off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DFW was not the place to fly through today. I think every flight out is delayed at this point. txwx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I love about AmericanAir Admiral's Club: the cool people who roll through here. Very nearly collided with Alex Kingston fangirl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh, no it's not. When thunder roars, go indoors! Game can wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least it didn't do it on the plane!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I text husband to complain about flight delay. He texts back about our kitty with clingons who decided to play keep away. HeWins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see the one I picked is green in the things that matter to me! vpn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think you meant treats. They will sniff out treats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please don't tag me in these. I'm not a supreme Court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had an amazing view of Mt. Rainier on our AmericanAir flight out of Seattle. It seems a little short though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear CNN and cnnbrk, I think maybe you've forgotten what actual breaking news is. McCain worried news really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downside to new webcam: tentaclekitty no longer sits on top of it. Upside: it has a built-in privacy cover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short answer was no, the human couldn't do it either. One of the flights is "under airport control" and can only be changed there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UGHHHHHHH. I just called and your stupid IVR says it can't help me. Trying to convince it to let me speak to a person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a Costco member, they have great discounts. Costco<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>120k miles last year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. Something is broken in AmericanAir seat assignment system. Can't change my seats for past 2 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would not use a car in downtown NOLA. Great and plentiful alternatives. And you don't have to pay outrageous parking prices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And again with the craptacular NeuLionSupport TheWHL feed. Might as well listen to radio and draw my own illustrations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're all students, all the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In light of my previous tweet, I'm relieved to know I got a perfect score on this quiz! cybersecurity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This. TheWHL NeuLionSupport NeuLionInc we've missed the last two goals because it keeps freezing, even w/lowest rez video<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'd blame the audio engineer, but just in case that job falls to one of you, I don't want to be rude!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, more like you have a tin can and string<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually felt kind of bad for them that their fans didn't show. Maybe fans knew blowout ahead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Brrrrrrr!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Category: proxy-avoidance-and-anonymizers" also blocked ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear BarclaycardUS, if you're going to make me verify EVERY CHARGE, at least let me do it electronically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except doesn't block other large downloads. Just IMAP ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never understand why "open" wifi blocks IMAP. Don't most people use wifi to check their e-mail??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's weird. A hotel charge at a place I regularly stay tripped a fraud alert on my credit card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Managed to work "earth that was got all used up" into my class today. Somebody even got the reference. nerdlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today some tool who said he got my cell # from amazon called. He REALLY wanted me to join Amazon Biz. He did not get that # from them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short flight. Air on full + G&T. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know. But I can get the sneezes and the itchy eyes. gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody near me on this plane reeks of cigarette smoke. This might be the death of me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a trainee dispatcher dress me down on her first day. To the point that the super had shortly started to move in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Delta flight attendant just came to tell me where my connecting gate is since she knew I have a tight connection. thankyou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was glorious without the explanation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darn that autocorrect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually said iflyalaska to slightly overbearing delta credit card sales guy at DTW. He tried to tell me they're still partners. nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is the second time since December that my defcon sticker has prompted "hey, do you know irongeek_adc". Need to remedy the "no".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's unfair. Sometimes the game is only viewable from one side of the table!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>+100. I changed phones a month ago and I'm still dealing with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is that now I know it's there, I have a nearly overwhelming urge to rickroll him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Somebody has a Chromecast attached to this hotel network. I may or may not have just sent him my cats fav YouTube video of birds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot how much I love the CamCard app. Big stack of business cards retrieved from backpack and put in contact list in record time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hopefully your coffee stand also gives out dog biscuits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They put a Lounge out there, so I think they're staying . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're under construction right now, which adds to the chaos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sitting in a plane for the competition. I've lost count of the number of people in leggings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What on earth are they wearing to get them barred from flying??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Few things scarier than a wildfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have come to loath SeaTacAirport gate N16. No AlaskaAir flight leaving from that gate goes smoothly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, that too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully they send him the bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was a throwback. Saw a TWA tail on a plane at SeaTac. Cc: AmericanAir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For when our hockey season is over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always think "life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone, I hear you call my name, and it feels like home" for penalties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't unread that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my seat neighbors wears one sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usually only their parents do. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no doubt breathing loudly at that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude: (stands at glass during play). Me: Hey, sit down Dude: Me: YOU IN THE BRODEUR JERSEY, SIT DOWN Dude: (Moves away from glass)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be RealmofHelm. He clearly brought his playoff game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he clearly knew it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought for sure we wouldn't have time to get to the word sabotage, but then pucktease<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. linkinpark. Thanks RealmofHelm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you haven't made it over there yet, Phil from HockeyHOF is here. You know, the guy who escorts the Stanley Cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we just need some Sabotage for some of those suspicious calls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was great to see Ron up there on the big screen! Some of his housemates sit right in front of us (the umbrella people!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless you're Enthusiastic Grandma. Then it's VoleCAN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I may have met him. Pretty sure he traded me his extra magnet one night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Random fact for the night: SeattleTbirds Coach K and TCAmericans Coach W played for the pdxwinterhawks in 91/92 season. IWasThere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My goal is to watch the game, so I assume I will miss much relevant tweeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super enthusiastic grandma is here tonight too. So we'll be listening to her yell at Grope and Nools all night. winthecup letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pre-ordered a PNW_Metros jersey of my very own!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Loose vinyl floor tile in bathroom. Now broken tile and cut toe. Having drawn blood, it is now time for bed. goodnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how you know the game is over. WHLPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whew. Made it. Missed less than half the game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to AlaskaAir getting us home almost half an hour early, I still get to see most of the SeattleTbirds game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, that's a super nerdy stat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My plane is on final approach to SeaTac. I'll be there soon!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could. If I could get enough bandwidth! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh Gogo. I hope you get upgraded internet everywhere soon. Not enough capacity for the masses on AlaskaAir 729 tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know it's SeattleTbirds playoff hockey time when you book your WingzTeam ride straight to ShoWareCenter from the airport.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nice morning for a flight. Thanks for the view AlaskaAir. If you look close, you can see 4 volcanos! iflyalaska<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No no no no no<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm still disturbed by the fact that a DUI interlock device company is sponsor of our youth hockey team. seattle tbirds hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did that post-penalty faceoff happen at center? Not that I'm complaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be out of town. Hence the extra ticket!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the last regular season game. Usually lots of fun for fans. We're still battling for 1st place though, so STRESS!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on victoriaroyals. We believe in you! Time for an epic comeback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have an extra club seat for tomorrow's Tbirds game. DM me if you're part of the flock and want it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, guessing he'll be a one term type<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or 8 years. Either way, I was required to check my phone during the night for 10 years. Done with that. I get caught up once a day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The BOI/SEA flight had something amazing the other night, but apparently I got the name wrong. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a fan of those front seats in the puddle jumper. I have a favor to ask though. Will you tell me what beer they have today??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ouch. States can't replace this money. This would directly impact public safety and leave big holes in preparedness and response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we love you Portland. Anarchists Are Fixing Potholes On City Streets<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No, no we do not. Only dogs do that as best as I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, your presentation room has great internet they said. There's capacity for everyone they said. Posting from my hotspot because NO.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think this is now an appropriate tune realmofhelm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get off my lawn!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving the ZamboniJohn special! SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, she's a local. Has been behind me the past 3 games I think. And she's well aged and VERY enthusiastic. Loudly so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We might need to round up a search party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I'm hopefully not going to crash a drone into a crowd of people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super enthusiastic lady is back. And we have players named Grope, Nools, and VoleCAN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In no particular order: Justin Trudeau, hockey, poutine, Timbits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the meantime, you can watch the NWHL's CTWhale_NWHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My point is that there weren't enough of them then, so odds not in their favor to get a team again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presumably it was stolen though because it wasn't financially viable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except they've had hockey there for a long time. Should be more enthusiasm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to an AHL game in Hartford a couple of weeks ago. I was underwhelmed by their fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we still have two days to go ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is that nobody around you can think about anything either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, thin mints need to come with a mute button. I can hear my box of them screaming for me downstairs ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have fun. And I'll see some of you next week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh look, here's me saying things. And this event was the most fun I've had in a long time! SayCyberOneMoreTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truck behind me has a bubble blowing machine on it. Blowing bubbles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey infosec people, here's a pentest contract for a county government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a Facebook page and a Fitbit. He is nerdcat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was going to do something useful, but then ButtersOK decided to take a nap on my feet. He is happy. My feet are warm. DoNotDisturb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was me for a long time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At a county meeting. Employee: did you see that helicopter onthe pad? Me: yeah, whose was it? Them: we don't know. ThingsThatMakeYouGoHmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wayyy back in the day I helped manage a free foot clinic at a small rural hospital. this kind of thing still makes me sad. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he conveniently has a two-syllable last name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, he is a local, so maybe it was an "accident" ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except there's usually a girl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally new crew from the looks of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate Tuesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. Gonna be late to hockey. Because traffic. Horrible traffic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DM me your e-mail. I know these people. Also, head straight to the Gender and Disaster Network.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope it's ok that I laughed at this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best wedding photos ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On yeah. One near me is a 911 backup site.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We also let select community groups use ours (like the school dist safety committee) and all our vol mtgs were there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Training facility and/or computer training lab. My IT Dept was biggest champion because they needed training space<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My console is just my office now, but still. I would never leave a cookie behind. At least not a good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And just ignore the crumbs on there. I have no idea where they came from ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one has been in service just over 2 years. It's backlit, so missing letters become mystery glows!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to go with a "no" on the letters. I DO need the little bumps on F and J though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2.5 million files later, system scan complete. All is well. Except maybe I need to clean up some files.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What delay are your speaking of? I was commenting on my data hording nature . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not the first time. Just the first time in a very long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Norton full system scan has scanned more than 2 million files and is still going ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just read Wired article on the Jigsaw Conversation AI. I'm sure you're familiar with it, but this tweet encapsulates the why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only I was an IEMC trainer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would totally play this game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right? The sun is out now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's more like what spring has come to. it's not supposed to snow in March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let it snow! wawx auburnwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp. That's definitely snow coming down. wawx auburnwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we love the Puget Sound.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I burned one out. Then I found out my Credit Union will take shredding piles at no cost. So now mine is for small batches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm. AlaskaAir shows me waitlisted for first class. On a Q-400. Maybe I get to fly it? newperk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because it's a neverending line! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems no different than what's been happening. I've never had anything other than a "full pat down" when I opt out. Of varying quality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They found it! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some might chunky rain coming down. SkySlurpee WAWX AuburnWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh, Apparently I left my Avalanche treasure in my hotel room. Hopefully SHS_Denver will find it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My worst was on a flight from MSP to SEA. Plane dropped straight down. Not sure how far, but I doused 2 rows in red wine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently not everyone was ready for the wind in Denver. Watched DIA Ops race around the tarmac chasing engine covers. hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Denver has interesting skies. This one looks like a portal to another dimension is about to rip open. cowx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Avalanche couldn't score but at least I got a game used puck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's going to sit for 2 and think about what he did. hockey StLouisBlues vs Avalanche<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though this is much of my view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair, their play is reminiscent of the mightyducks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Observation: Avalanche fans are sad and depressed. And are nearly outnumbered by the loud and enthusiastic StLouisBlues fans. sadpandas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are a house divided. nextera hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good seats. hockey denver Avalanche vs StLouisBlues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay, Denver! And flight attendant basically just thanked the whole plane for not being jerks during this while adventure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two recent AlaskaAir flights with flight attendant trainees on-board. You wouldn't know though except for their nametags and watchful eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of these days I'm actually going to poke myself in the eye with one of those stir sticks. We're finally on our way to Denver though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I'm starving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 hour, 48 minutes later, we're ready. But people in the bathroom, so we can't move. *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And pretty sure I *have* said that on assignment!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's tomorrow, so yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A litany of little holdups. Pilot just said "this just isn't our day".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uggggggh. We made it to the taxiway, and then literally had to pull over and stop. Now "paperwork issue".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tug broke! Got a new one. Now waiting for de-ice. I guess it got cold while we sat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This flight should be free drinks for everyone. We've been sitting for an hour with a small person screaming most of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we started to push back, there was a huge lurch and now we're sitting again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the plus side, it's probably a good experience for the FA trainees on-board!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently we went from "waiting for baggage" to "have to fix something". Door is open now for paperwork signoff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wierdly, our flight shows departed, but we're sitting on the plane at N16, wondering what's going on. This is now a big delay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I blame the crowd headed to Honolulu before us. They were already on island time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>668. Short delay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. One city to the north of me. Get your act together America. This is not ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. Unannounced AlaskaAir delay. We're supposed to be boarding, but no plane yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was a Nordiques fan, so have followed them for many years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They traded my fav player this week, so I'm a little sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colorado Avalanche (my team) vs StLouisBlues (hubby's team). housedivided<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hockey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like a beautiful day for flying! Here we come Denver! iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, yeah, sure I did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And thank you autocorrect for that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New Girl Scout Snores cookies are meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Iverson has to be the worst ref in TheWHL. GoBackToFootlocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hockey fans do more math this time of year than any other time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, simbacam is my favorite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what's up with E. Bear?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The super enthusiastic old lady is loudly yelling GROPE again instead of Gropp. I'm dying . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The super enthusiastic old lady is right behind us tonight. gameon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll have to look! I sorted by size first and deleted giant things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are almost 20K e-mails in my sent items folder, dating back to 2004. I have a hording problem ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Connecticut was 70 when I was there last weekend. I find it very confusing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>White House proposes steep budget cuts for NOAA. This could be devastating for EM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm headed to Denver tomorrow, where it's supposed to be almost 70 degrees. psychowinter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not interested in a debit card, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda bummed that my new AlaskaAir BankofAmerica Visa no longer features the northern lights. Made it unique! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many EOCs though don't have that kind of depth. Need to use vols as force multipliers, whether they be ham, SMEM, both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And reality is that you need somebody in EOC dedicated to comms and SMEM monitoring. EM alone can't do. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or EMs can get their FCC license and talk. Better to have way two-way convo and ham in the EOC. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not seeing poll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had my ham team trained to also do SMEM. Steep curve for some though, simply due to pace. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In some places hamradio and smem are linked. Many hams scared of SMEM, tho it's just message traffic!. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found an old online account. Login still worked. No option to cancel account. Customer service e-mail bounces. WhatToDo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ewwwwww<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So excited to have Desi from FITreadytogo speaking to our GeorgetownEDM Risk Perception/Risk Communication classes today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think you have the wrong scba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have. It was delayed and there's nothing anybody can do about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. Ordered 2 projectfi SIMs on the same day. One got here in 4 days. Other still in transit 10 days later. Needed it tomorrow. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bah. Have front row tix to Avalanche this weekend. They traded away my fav player. I even have an Iginla jersey. Should've gotten Pickard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that Starbucks tea is hot enough to melt your face off. I always forget to ask them to leave room for a little ice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So maybe just outside the job then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could give up making decisions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shoot me an email and I'll scare some up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's our official page:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't really have events other than our monthly meetings, on the first Friday of every month. Tho we added a meetup in Dallas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. It speaks to our screwness during the big one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or laptop stands. Mine looked at me with the wildest eyes when I tried that tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. I don't get even questioning this. though it would have been nice to find a way to evac the freeway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That happened to us in Costa Rica of all places<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the tweet stream and listening to the scanner from Carbondale. Hoping everybody is ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bought two phones for the parents there last week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now it looks like Comcast biz internet is crapping itself. I've had like 30 seconds of fully working internet today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attn WxKyleNelson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sharing my office with a ladybug right now. Too cold to put it outside. It's safe here unless a cat spots it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing. Literally. I had to force it to update and it had 2 rounds to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not. I just play one on the Internet sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So apparently NortonOnline's live update doesn't actually process updates in a timely manner. Blerg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Worst customer service ever from avis just now. Their reservation website told me I had to call. I did. Super rude, not helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was more like "can I have a new job, everybody hates me"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We did a large tabletop exercise 2 weeks ago around this scenario. I randomly got picked to represent "Cloud Services". ugly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a biggie. Just missing a SIM. They were able to tell me it should arrive tomorrow. Just in time for "phones with the parents"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hubs and I working from home today. Little cat thinks we should play. Keeps going to remote parts of house and MEOWING for us. lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope projectfi keeps us this awesome level of customer service. Instant help via chat. Question answered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>+1000<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear TMobile, what exactly is an "out of plan" number? It has a US area code. Iowa to be specific.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. AWS is having "issues".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kudos to BankofAmerica and the AlaskaAir Visa. They proactively sent me a new card because my existing one was breached (tho not used).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far as excuses go, that one gets high marks for creativity and trendiness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good. Hopefully this trend can be stopped before it really picks up steam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?! But you're in Portland, right, so I guess that makes sense. I'm jealous though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A growler of kombucha??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go find a nice bottle of kombucha to drink. Makes the tummy happier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh. That's not good. Mine didn't really hurt, though I have nerve entanglement, so half my face was numb for a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was probably 5 or 6 days later. My cheeks got really hot and I could feel the knots in them. I will never, ever forget that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Puss. In well, my mouth. Aren't you glad you asked?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine went well until the bottom two got infected. That was fairly gross. Maybe the grossest thing ever in fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh, yeah. We've spent a lot of time planning for it, but we can't fix the infrastructure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, no unless faced with a warrant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snow during rush hour is always pandemonium around here. Combine it with closed freeways, and today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He works in Elliot Bay. Left work 4ish, right as snow started coming down I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I'll watch this for a little bit then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like husband's normal 45 minute commute from Seattle to Auburn is going to end up being roughly 210 minutes tonight. grumpy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do a search for "riverside". Will fill your feed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, happened a few hours ago. I saw a just in time photo from the scene<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Add WA to the list. Going on right now in Mercer Island.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not good at all. Get your act together America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or use the internal referral system at a company and bypass the recruiter part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get the non-technical HR recruiter types to take a look. You gotta get past them to get to the infosec ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's where you phone a friend and have them do a brutal resume review. It can sting a little, but so worth it sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband's 45 minute drive now estimated 2.5 hours. I'll have dinner ready! wawx tanker seattle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to call that Thunder Shail. Thunder + snow/hail mixed. Exciting weather today! WAWX auburnwa seattlewx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've always loved that song, but when I first heard that version, it blew my mind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question answered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Google was completely unhelpful on that particular point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have we checked to see if the government did something nefarious in the ensuing chaos?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, how does that eve happen? YouHadOneJob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My twitter feed just exploded with yelling and I have no idea what's going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto. And I've seen it more than once from some recognized schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. Pointed that out. I trust the source, but suspect bad guidance from program.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The super enthusiastic lady behind us keeps saying Grope instead of Gropp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody needs a dream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is per AndyEide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah, those suckers can really sting when the ricochet off the glass. askmehowiknow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a lady just to the right of that photo who is currently bleeding from a small facial wound caused by rebound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Pat's Plumbing. They use an undisguised human<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my favorite things about chuck-a-puck. SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus he's always yapping at them and nipping at heels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think maybe you pushed the wrong button there WHLsilvertips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. There is a very vocal, very enthusiastic, very old lady behind us. We're all trying not to giggle. She's a true fan though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahahaha. We're still coming for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My official fav mascot was the guy from Pat's Plumbing, compete with toilet plunger and pipe wrench on his belt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We think he might have ended up frozen to the ice . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My takeaway from that game is Blitz is kind of a jerk. Picking on little kids. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a new twist, the mascots are playing against small people. seattletbirds mascotnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm working on a cyber response plan for 16 cities. Once written, we'll exercise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got first ever delta upgrade from my AlaskaAir status. Probably the last too, given their pending divorce. And I'll likely sleep thru it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting up at 0320 isn't so hard when you couldn't sleep at all. goinghome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They would be very confused. They didn't even stand-up when their team came on the ice!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bye bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AHL is fun with all the WHL alumni. Nice to see them get a shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Realized too late that I hadn't yet setup Periscope on the new phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! Work trip. Ended in a hockey game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Hometown Heroes night in Springfield. Sirens in an arena are LOUD! tbirdsahl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Might show them my ACLU membership card. Been giving this significant thought given how much I travel. Honestly don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day two of training for ct_vost and CT MRC. Meeting fellow MRC members is always fun! ctvost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got it fixed a couple of days ago, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was kinda of excited to see such a thing, just because it's pretty unique.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a weird one. Somebody's Twitter account hijacked, but hijacker didn't change the e-mail address. User back in control, but suspended.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad you could make it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said something similar to a group of students last week. Some cool demos out there already. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched a new batch of Connecticut MRC members swear their oath. Cool! volunteers MRC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're total money pits. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. LOL. etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course you are! I'm sitting in Goodwin College.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bringing some social media goodness to CT MRC with epimetra, It's great to be back in Connecticut again! SMEM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I almost went there. The racecar in my garage IS a Trans AM, w/manual tranny. Unfortunately it also has blown rear end<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Probably be dark then. Waiting on my next bus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my impression of Boston is that is just one big tunnel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suspect this transition from my AlaskaAir first class seat to the 3-hour bus ride seat is going to be painful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not this time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Hubs did. I was in basement, he was in attic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they got him. Good dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus at had a small earthquake about an hour ago, so they're freaked out anyway<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear neighbor, walking up to a cop with an AR in to see what's going on is going to get you yelled at.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great. Cops with guns all over my neighborhood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No shuttles at PDX. In fact, I'll be there tomorrow myself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know a certain drummer ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool! wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And really it's all first responders. The consequence management piece is huge and overlooked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Portland, this is a great event, run by great people! painting autism art<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. Turned down a last minute teaching gig cuz doc appt today. Doc just canceled. Lost $$$ and get another week of pain. This week blows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your customer service agents need to be better informed. He told me I had no choice. And it's done, so it can't be undone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And therein lies the problem. I've installed it at least 3 times. And yet it's not there when I search for it. PITA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My old agency does that. And they're well schools in SM. Their primary audience isn't on Twitter though, so not focus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not much to look into. Per you cust svc, disputing a charge requires card cancellation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was fun! Always good to bring the west coast sensibilities to the EMLife table. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's really weird is how our three backgrounds have so much in common but never crossed until we hit EM. smallworld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guest speaking with CherylBle and schuback for the UNT Tech and EM undergrad class. Yay for nerds. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is like mdeyerin2.0??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bah. This makes me sad. It was a great presentation. eTechOps mdeyerin iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alas, I have DMB or my 1917 Seattle Stanley Cup Champions hoodie. (printed in 2017, not 1917)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is my davematthewsbnd hoodie a poor choice for a work related video conference??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I need some offline time. I'm yelling at my Tweetdeck feeds ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm very glad you're doing selfies right now! Heal soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you pointed to the exact reason it's a bad idea. People using it now, for a storm that hasn't happened yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the public got together an collectively picked Doris? Or was it suggested to them by a commercial entity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why letting a commercial entity name storms is a bad idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So ShoWareCenter refuses to fix a fraudulent charge and BarclaycardUS punishes me by cancelling my card. Just in time for a work trip.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have some info I can send. But I'm at Costco right now. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, same one. Just got lost in the shuffle probably<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, not just cities. Counties and States too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably won't pass legal challenge, but big questions until that actually happens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, first week in the job. Is on the Whitehouse website<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are treatment facilities for such addictions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes sense since they were the contractors and not the spokespeople.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope so. We're going to the game on the 5th and I'd really like a win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now it's "please win a game".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, whatever! Go Avs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hubby had one of those. Scratched the crap out of it in his sleep. Now giant scar. Pro tip: don't do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a WHL game, not an AHL game. Does that matter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I complained to NeuLionSupport about this. Response: NO for Android. And now there's no audio at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mostly watching pdxwinterhawks feed makes me want burgerville. Such a long drive for a burger though. Mmmmmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe release app for Amazon Fire TV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but I want to cast to my big screen, not watch on a computer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like streaming thewhl games. But I want to listen to SeattleTbirds audio, not pdxwinterhawks. NeuLionSupport says NO for Android.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have that same shirt! Glad to know I'm in good company. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first center had a bathroom off dispatch. We could lock the front door, use the radio code for water emer and be FAST<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How was that not too many men?!?!?!?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I the camera on this new phone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a goal! SeattleTbirds hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching SeattleTbirds game on TV and audio dropped? Apparently the TV road crew doesn't believe in gaffer's tape. Box door cut the cable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always amusing when you can figure out where somebody learned their moves . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Papp needs to go back to Foot Locker. Seattle hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But he gets plenty from the Oilers and they're going to reward him with a nice paycheck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think with that goal, Ethan becomes the highest scoring defenseman ever drafted by the Oilers. They wrote an article about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you need a reminder! Seattle hockey historylesson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is possibly my fav HockeyChallenge matchup!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hit my first projectfi snag. whispersystems Signal app sends SMS, but phones receives in Hangouts. Hmmm .....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I supposed best option is property managers have own plans to deal with stuck elevators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a really tough one. There simply aren't going to be enough resources to get to everybody in a timely manner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should publicly shame them, but I've suppose they have no shame.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dude. We've had a mumps outbreak here that's being going on since December. They don't expect it to end until end of school year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a really hard sell in many areas. Take extreme fire/LEO cooperation, plus school and parent buy-in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not mine to share, except that this is one of the few districts in the country that even does this<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was awkward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awkwardhug cam ftw!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially with this short bench<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whose idea was it for the SeattleTbirds to play 6 games in 8 nights, across 2 countries? brutal hockey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Best way to spend Valentines . . . SeattleTbirds hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I got something in my eye ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are heart shaped pizzas a thing? valentines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's capitalized every single time! Sometimes 4 times on one slide!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm mildly amused that this ISO 27032 course uses the term "the Cyberspace". And it uses it a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The number of people who gave up on evac and went back home due to gridlock was staggering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't live in flood prone areas with limited egress! That's lesson number one. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably. But waiting for it to resolve right now. Lots to learn from it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the author can't see your protest because your account is protected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. But there are plenty of domestic abusers out there who are never reported. I know, not what the article is talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only if they're convicted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been one of those years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, but you're a rockstar. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And some of the original messaging include Sacramento. Huge swath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a tough call. Esp with the limited evac options there. Not enough capacity regardless of which way you do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone should have a baby goat at least once in their life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They got really, really lucky last night. SM was full of people who gave up on evac due to gridlock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless it was Butte County Sheriff. He did say in presser that it was the hardest decision he's ever made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't believe so. It was in the NWS Flash Flood Warning 3 times. I don't think they were messaging for somebody else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was NWS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much for rebooting. Now my nvidia driver update is stuck and the machine is sitting in limbo ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to reboot more often . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the best! My hubby sends me pictures of our cats when I'm away. Funny how that can totally change the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I don't think you can remove yourself from somebody's list, except by blocking them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can still check manually though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually like this. But from the opposite side. I like to add accounts to lists without being noticed ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More importantly, take action on the federal disaster request that California put in on the 10th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[machine learning, AI!]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least they brought them back and didn't dump them!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Might be a great iaem conference session if somebody wants to. "SM Monitoring in the age of spam & politics"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a best practice. But I don't often see agencies saying "here's our recommended list of accounts to get official info"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm thinking specifically lists of official sources (the same ones that EMs would use). And giving that list to the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it's not easier for the public. It's easy for us, but how does the public get the info they need in realtime?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe one solution is for agencies to create lists and share those with public. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sheer volume of political posts has gotten overwhelming. That's going to spill into everything. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your comments from that incident were part of our conversation! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And can be difficult to setup on the fly during a crisis, from a mobile device, while trying to evac! smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In reality, all disasters are human-made. If it weren't for the humans, there would be no disasters. chicken and egg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes a good case for AI and machine learning. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was talking about that last night with Tarantino4me. We're going to have to come up with some algorithms to filter the ick out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a moment I thought that was a bottle of vodka ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is it with California? You're either on fire or drowning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were speculating that it might have been for the potential hospital evac.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forts are the best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking of . . . Apparently he's my monitoring assistant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And now "we're boarding by group", but they just also said everybody who had previously checked in. So everybody went.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And apparently that line was not for boarding. It was for making sure we had a pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Small plane, so hopefully my backpack fits under the seat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, new drama. Instead of calling groups, they just did an all call. So now I'm at almost the end of the line instead of Priority. dumb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New plane, new gate, busted escalator to get to it. And now passengers being dumb. I sense this drama is not yet over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting in ORD. Headed for Cincinnati. Eventually. I hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annnnnd, I just looked out the window as our original plane rolled away from the gate. Hopefully AmericanAir is getting us a new one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sigh. AmericanAir just popped up a 10 minute delay for our flight. Says it now leaves 2 minutes from now. NotHappening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now we're back in the terminal, waiting to see if AmericanAir can fix the plane or if they have to find us a new one. FlightDelay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thankfully it's not freezing outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grumpy gate agent just went down to the plane. Grumpy because he has half the plane checked in and now has to undo that. And still we wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Walking down boarding ramp. Mechanical delay. Everybody turned around, but now we're stuck on the ramp and can't get back in the terminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad to be missing yet another Seattle snowstorm. Especially one with actual snow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And one of them is super excited about puppybowl myhero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have 2 hours to kill in the AmericanAir Club. I can hear those blessed little brownies calling to me. iflyalaaka and sometimes American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmm mmm. WafflesOnAPlane iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, but I don't have cable. Or an OTA antenna.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching WHL live stream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still playing for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But you'll note that their mascots can skate. No broom hockey in PDX!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to the pdxwinterhawks radio feed. ThomBeuning, could you walk over to ToddVrooman and tell him how to say Volcan? please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actuallivingscientist is the best thing on Twitter today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm actually ok with this. And I thought it had already been changed to "members only" a while back ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I know that drummer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay for the band (I know the drummer!). :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's my sincere belief that there is media manipulation going on, for the purpose of discrediting them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There have been other transgender Mayors. I believe the first was in Silverton, Oregon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only if it's his current or former doctor or w/access to his recs. If it's somebody talking out their $$, no violation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already booked my flight, with companions!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to decide between ScienceMarchDC or SciMarchSeattle. Leaning toward DC ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if their families are Americans. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang. Windy in auburnwa. Just popped a 36 MPH gust. wawx seawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's one for you from this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mt. St. Helens with a Mt. Adams photobomb. iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely view of Mt. St. Helens this morning. iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blame these guys. They look they're up to no good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have a much more interesting view. We're at 36k, skimming the top of soup! Blue above us though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting on the plane in Sacramento, waiting for last passengers to board. Big fog just rolled in. Hopefully no delay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Local police derive their powers from state/local law. Not all allow for enforcement of laws beyond state ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or how many more might have actually voted. That's the larger problem in my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it's sooooo early!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best hockey post of the season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would have officer's motives be questioned? That's crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a good, yet terrifying, read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And circle back to last week when they were in favor of torture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except "we the people"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>13 at SEA now too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goodbye all my frequent flyer miles, hello Asia in style! SEA ->DBX ->SIN ->HKG ->SEA booked. scenicroute iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got it via desktop. Very different wording than what that article said! Wonder if interims have authority to exempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not mobile friendly apparently. No actual link to the order text.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had no luck finding the original document text. Only the public comments. Can you point me to it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That article says only military has blanket exemption. All others are case-by-case and must be asked for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was hoping the public safety exemption rumor was true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing on the internet today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody know if the fed hiring freeze prevents hiring seasonal wildland firefighters? emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My morning news read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used FromYouFlowers and was very happy. Maybe get money back from ftdflowers and start over??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to be at National Harbor tomorrow night if I know anybody who wants to join me for dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch the FEMA website for current disaster declarations. Can also sign-up for their email list. Probably PDX news too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does sanctuary city + disaster = no FEMA assistance? Portland is about to find out. Already talk of denying Public Assistance funds. EMlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyday I feel more and more like we're in an extended episode of Futurama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. And I don't want that to happen. I want you and every other Muslim in America to feel safe and secure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that it's even become a topic is horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also EMPG grants, which fund emergency management at the local level. Also, disaster relief funds via Stafford Act are grants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Politburo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Youngster's cutting corners!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So nice of you to set of a raptor buffet. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Say hi from me to the folks in St. Clair County today. I was there last year to do Whole Community Training. NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was initially very confused about why I might want to date an earthquake. I'm married and that could be awkward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the record, this is also Pixel, very much alive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what friends are for, right? Sharing the iFlyAlaska love!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sleet and freezing rain were not in the Maryland forecast, yet here they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If my alternative clearence ends with my stuff thrown out of my room, Ima be grumpy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this just got interesting. Somebody in security has decided my clearence is no longer valid and they're threatening to boot me!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That can probably be arranged ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're teaching the brand new curriculum for the first time this week. Day one is less firehoseish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 1 of the fema national basic academy underway. Diverse group of students from across the country! Looking forward to a great week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turnarounddontdrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was here week before last too. 12 degrees when I got here. 65 by Thursday. I was very confused!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EMI, per usual!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the roof, not the hood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody goofed at femacamp. No record that I was supposed to be here. Security had to call people. Then housing had to find a room. oops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They weren't kidding about this turbulence in the air either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like fema is going to get it's first test under the new admin, with an interim leader. Good luck BobatFEMA!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Captain is expecting turbulence into DC. Everybody buckle up and hold on. It's gonna be a bumpy ride. It's not a metaphor but it could be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your music choices tonight indicate you're feeling better RealmofHelm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Simba cam is my favorite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle Thunderbirds teddybeartoss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We do teddybeartoss right in 116! SeattleTbirds letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fastest I've ever seen .... IAWACS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I'm ready for this. My ACLU, EFF, and legalshield memberships are all paid up. 6 weeks of food/water on-hand. BringItOn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's what I think of every time I open it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recruiting people to Signal, one text at a time. privacyrules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, it's a good game. Half price ticket night brings out a different crowd. The kind who can't stay seated during play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The SeattleTbirds fan toss would be a lot more fun if we got to nominate fans and they actually got tossed . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But there will still be a dude in a Vader mask, riding a unicycle, playing bagpipes. Because Portland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what prompted my post<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess now we wait for the next announcement?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm more worried that sometimes staff can be the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the con has an app, it could be in there too. Not sure changing the codenames would really help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do we make it happen in a way that doesn't backfire?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get a notification everytime somebody adds me. I don't even have to look for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5 years ago today, I was a guest of Israel National Police at their natl disaster conference and terrorism exercise. Lots of fun & learning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only problem is that it tells them you've put them on a list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a whole new level of weird, even for California!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we need Noise in the house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quits reading the SIM. It's not the sim tho, as it works fine in the burner. Same thing happened to my G2. Hastening my move to Fi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. My phone has decided it only wants to be an internet device. This is the 2nd LG to do this. Done with them. Glad I have spare phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landed early. Gate occupied. Sitting. And some lady is out of her seat, being ordered to sit back down over the PA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I look forward to the day AlaskaAir has a lounge partner at IAD. Tho I love vinovolo, camping here all afternoon can get spendy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enforce is an ominous word. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know an activity isn't going quite as planned when participant asks who the "plant" is and there isn't one. Just people being themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF Word?? I don't have time for you have problems that require you to restart. Especially 10 times ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will your service be back up again? Page doesn't load correctly, login hangs, site unusable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. This is a fancy new Metro train. It's got clean seats, shiny floors, and electronic signs inside showing stops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I remember how cold it is at femacamp in January. Not the coldest I've ever seen here, but still brrrrrrrr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummmmm, gross??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for reminding me that I have some Via in my backpack!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. Forgot to pack my instant espresso. And femacamp coffee is the WORST!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we leave explosives to the experts . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fast jet stream, but it sure is bumpy! Can see altitude changes in the contrails all over. Nobody can find a smooth ride! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny thing about heading off to femacamp is the number of people on the plane who I know. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you were wondering what a seahawks playoff touchdown looks like on the seismograph!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My stomach still hurts from laughing. I just hope they don't refuse to use it. PS: it's also a dog feeder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May be bad kitty owner. New wifi feeder. Cats investigating. Pressed feed button. Kibble+stainless=loud/scary. 2 kitties, wood floor, RUN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that's no so bad. I'm upgraded, so they'll put it in the closet for me. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a pretty cool story. No pun intended ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weather nerds, what's your fav software for connecting your PWS to sites like wunderground? I use VWS, but it's gotten kludgy. wx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate packing for the east coast this time of year. 12 degrees tomorrow night, 59 by Friday. I know, pack layers. But still ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the worst. I hate ice, especially when it's hiding under snow. Bad things happen on street ice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always cite your sources kids . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been making those donations since 1992 . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I both love and hate this ice pack. Keeping it in the deep freeze makes it particularly painful . . . IceIceBaby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you just have that message set as a macro so you can quickly post it? Seems to get used enough ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good. Then we can go karaoke songs with bad words and YouTube them ... :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That radio traffic right there was ominous as hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazon just offered me a subscribe and save on a desk lamp. How many lamps do normal people go through??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not, but I bet they'll reimburse us for it after we build it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are days when I contemplate leaving government service simply so I can have a public opinion again ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know he doesn't have two-factor on that thing, so it's bound to happen eventually ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Test message - pst314<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus I found some journal and trade articles on the current threat landscape. One that addresses all tech, not just internet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually think I may have found some appropriate stuff. I read some of the old and decided it was still good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, no :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time using ubereats. Hoping for yum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Con mucho gusto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just sent you the link to the translated stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Although even the diehards aren't wearing sandals this week. It was 16 when I got up this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preparing for a rainstorm Seattle style "put on socks with your sandals maybe?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I was being funny! I think I might have something. Standby ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is this preparing for a rain storm you speak of??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't make me punch my pretty new monitor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For undergrads, if that helps. Mostly not tech savvy. The takeaway for many is "holy crap, I need virus protection".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should have been more specific. I need articles and the like, as it's for 1 week of a class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to compile a short reading list that defines cyber crime, cyber terrorism, and covers basic cyber hygiene topics. Suggestions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was a datasocietyco backer. Finally going to take advantage and learn some new stuff! New year, new knowledge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re-learning to play the piano may be more than my hands and arms can handle ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all seriousness, thanks to avis for reaching out and making this whole mess right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. It was somebody else's rental. Your people just didn't look at the paperwork close enough. Bad form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now the 3rd party biller looked at the docs that avis sent them and found there's no way the damage happened on my rental. TryHarder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this women at the avis 3rd party keeps calling me hon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now the avis 3rd party biller has hung up on me while transferring me to person 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now the avis 3rd party biller has decided I'm not in collections, it's just a bill. For as yet unspecified damages from 3 months ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. Now I find that avis has actually sent me to collections for something they never billed me for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice. I get home to a bill from some company avis hired, claiming I damaged a rental car 3 months ago. No proof, just a demand for money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's hoping our water pipes aren't frozen when we get home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My itineraey is on AlaskaAir , so that probably doesn't help you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey AmericanAir, your Admiral's Club crew at STL are charming and delightful. And they have brownies. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the record, you still skate better than most of us ever dream of. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who do I know in EM in Ohio (besides rusnivek)? Trying to promote upcoming PER 344 course in Glouster. SMEM NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's Wayne Gretzky sitting right here in the Admiral's Club ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of these for one 4-day trip for two people. It's been fun St. Louis! WinterClasic seahawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you trying to make me the actual crazy cat lady?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. Yeah, wild kitty eyes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In Portland there was always a NYE hockey game against Seattle. But then we moved to Seattle 19 years ago!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We usually sit at home and watch on TV. By usually, like 18 of the 20 years or so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know the bathroom line it's bad when bros are yelling at other bros for trying to jump the line.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Apparently extreme volume!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always! I found a calmer place with a straight shot to an outside exit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a butter knife . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guessing the fire marshall has never visited this place during an event this large. Holy crowd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, just the score. Announced it to his buddy and moved on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might look buried in my phone, but I'm really observing and tweeting things that amuse and entertain me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's sound activated and hasn't dimmed in half an hour. nyelivestl @ Ballpark Village St. Louis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mr. Oblivious next to me checked his phone for a football score. For a game visible on not less than 10 screens near us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mmm. Dessert. nyelivestl @ Ballpark Village St. Louis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So where should a Seahawks fan in stlouis go to watch the game tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will you have the Seahawks 49ers game on tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should have selfied! I never think of these things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pretty pathetic, especially with the water fountains winterized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dunno. Staff are confused too. Some sort of logistical breakdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second observation from WinterClassic Should have brought sunglasses. Oops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Observation from BuschStadium: there is no water available for purchase, even at the advertised price of $5.25/bottle. WinterClassic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Metrolink train whistle is one of the most annoying things I've ever heard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have 4 Blues jerseys between the two of us, dating back to the early 90s, because can't wear the same one to 2 games!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not my first STL rodeo! Last time here I slipped on ice and sprained my ankle * really* bad. Did not stop me from seeing Blues tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm too cheap to spend $70 on an uber Black. So waiting 20 minutes and spending $8 for the STL Metrolink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite the welcome party. 3 emergency vehicles. 6 medics and a gate agent on-board. Quick and efficient. And passengers actually sitting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Everybody remain in your seats while medics come onboard to help somebody. Never good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Screaming baby in first class on descent. Probably ears. Mom doing zero to try to help ears. clueless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's like the hallmark of Seattle! All the Twitter, all the time. GetUsedToIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw the AlaskaAir VirginAmerica differentworks plane at SEA. Sweet paint job! Stood out in the crowd. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would mess with them a little. Ears on -PREDATOR. Ears off - FRIEND. Repeat. They were such dorks. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean welcome back! Hubby grew up near there. This is more of a pilgrimage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had two cats that would FREAK out when I put on cat ears. They would watch me put them on and decide I was predator in that moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There must be an airplane traffic jam at SEA this morning. 4th AlaskaAir gate change for this flight, this one to a different terminal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is SEA->STL for the winterclassic! Go StLouisBlues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's possible that my husband is more excited about the alumni game roster than the actual roster. winterclassic letsgoblues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those are my favorites! If they left the cart near me, I would eat them all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really over this year. But I'm also terrified of the next one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to leave notes for them . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just made the mistake of logging out of my wunderground account. Now I can't get in and I see the message that their database is hosed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's weird. I use it every day from Chrome with no issues. With the paid version though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has been screwed up for couple of days. The app insists my account expired (it hasn't) and site e-mail is dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably seems bad because it's the Gen X celebs and we're hyper connected.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think I've counted 4, but I could be off, as I was immersed in Civ 5 on my main screen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's like the third mall emergency tonight. Crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not the scba you're looking for.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In case you were wondering, the sounds of ChristmasEve are apparently sirens. Lots and lots of sirens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the many reasons mine are indoor only!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ability to properly punctuate is such an overlooked skill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Christmas shout out to MattressFirm in Tri-Cities for preventing the biggest family Christmas debacle in years! MerryChristmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The kind that thinks volcanoes and lighting on their birthday are cool. Or just in general that those things are cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool! We have the IAEMETC mid-year meeting tacked on to the end as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're the same kind of weird ... :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm attending and speaking at gsmcon in Dallas this year for the first time, with maryjofly. That will be a nice SMEM thing. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just rain here and 38 degrees. Has been steady like this for hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I now that feeling! Just don't break for too long or none of those credits will transfer in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might have better luck with Yik Yak. Tho more complicated. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make sure you look at all the schools on the FEMA Higher Ed list before you choose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to be in your hood next weekend. And we have an extra pair of Alumni Game tix to sell if you know anybody looking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is this mall you speak of?? I thought all presents came from Amazon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, did you get the thing I mail you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fav question on Facebook yesterday: If there's no wifi on the plane, what's a workaround to get on the Internet. Uhhhhh TryAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching mandatory training. Video that's clearly being read by the person recording it. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Near Glouster, OH? Want to learn about SMEM? Signup for NDPTC's free Social Media Tools and Techniques course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landed 25 minutes ago. Door on the plane still not open. What's up with that AlaskaAir??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might have smem use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lady next to me is on Crown Royal 5 and we're two hours into the flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boarding doors about to close on the last flight home of the year. Thanks for shuttling me around all year AlaskaAir! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear AlaskaAir, could you get the Admiral's Club brownie recipe from your friends at AmericanAir and put those in the Lounge!? yum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the follow hulu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear WxKyleNelson, we're profiling you in NDPTC class today. You're welcome. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of this is a bit dated now, but good info on advanced searches, including Boolean queries. NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing on the Internet today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can read the official statement from iaem on this topic at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this is a new twist. I'd be happy to be paid to create hashtags for anyone who wants to pay me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still valid! NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for hosting NDPTC today FortWorthFire! Tarantino4me and I are looking forward to a great day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you see the video in the corner of the fishermen rescuing kittens??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn leaky eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm having trouble keeping up with all the alarming news today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes all us cat lovers look bad . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loves pics!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My semi-regular plea to uber, lyft, and WingzTeam to please make your receipts easy to print or PDF as ONE piece of paper. wasteful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a cat meowing in the cabin and a dog barking in the hold. This might be an interesting AlaskaAir flight! petsflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So RogueOne. Just go see it. Possibly my fav starwars movie since Empire!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude wearing an American flag pin and talking church just started putting a hard MLM pitch on the young people surrounding him. gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wearing a flapper dress to a shindig tonight. Waiting for the cats to realize I'm like one giant toy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incident outside house, me, gun one hand, calling 911 w/other, yelling "you need pants!" to hubby. PantsNotOptional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already have more TB of storage than that onsite, networked, with redundant external backup. And not TV, but that gives me idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this context, he was a hockey player with a bad attitude. Which was mostly solved by 10 minutes in the penalty box.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Layers. Lots of layers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think a Windows update borked my computer. Now ignores both "screen off" and "sleep" commands. *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But at least they have plenty of fuzz to keep them warm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was going to vote for the beer tosser in 117.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heck, even the PG player who did it got 10. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree x 100. ShoWareCenter SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bro dude needs to go dude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tis the season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From this angle, I saw Brown's stick nail him I the face. I thought even under the visor. Mighty dive tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?? Hockey is the best sport of all! There's even a pro women's league now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well yeah, but got gotta be a little stealthy about it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it was also a stupid place for Brown to put his stick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, tonight it was H O C K E Y reference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Old McDonald is a punk . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He had to be right below RealmofHelm maybe he saw who it was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope you appreciated the help on Oh Canada from that guy in 103 Motley_Su! He certainly had pipes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a long time to have to sit on $250. I suspect it would have to be replaced by then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, tall. He's a tall nerd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need nerd suggestions for what to get the hubby for Christmas. I went thru entire thinkgeek website and wired gift list and nada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrible. OfficerDown hostages<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the news keeps getting worse there. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mission accomplished. Except for some cable management. One up and out of the way unless something's going on. ThanksSanta smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to install the dual monitor arms and the new 27"4K monitor. Hopefully I return happy ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just wrapping up dev on grad course on risk perception and public comm. Hope to create more science talkers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When flaky weather station software decides to run itself twice, but only refresh the data in one instance. Sorry about that wunderground!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The guy was the doc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was the team doc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Electrician is coming tomorrow to confirm no actual damage done from the breaker box light and smoke show. And probably quote new panel. $$$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, that could be ButtersOK with a lion cut!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Home rules states can present a special challenge in that regard too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general, all disasters are local, so responsibility should be local, but cost prohibitive oftentimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not.Legislature is under orders from Judicial to fund education. Leg will throw disaster responsibility to locals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We would have bankrupted two counties in the last two years under this plan probably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The State of WA has a disaster fund, but refuses to actually fund it. Costs would be born by locals, not the state ultimately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had Thai food for lunch yesterday. Alas, no Indian food in my city. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn near! It was loud an flashy and, had I not had a long-sleeved shirt on, might have signed my arm hair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In today's edition of This Old House, the damned thing tried to electrocute me! Tomorrow will be spent with electricians. And a credit card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fascinating case. She's right to point out that we tell people NOT to click on mystery links.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear the cats are playing Marco Polo in the house right now. MEOW? MEOOW!! *gallop* meow? MEOW! *gallop* etc lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my snakeriverbrew Zonkers Stout from tavour did not survive the trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my all time favs. Used to watch him play for blazerhockey. Coming to Colorado to see him play in March! iggy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a very old doggy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Santa is bringing me a new 27" 4K monitor and a dual adjustable monitor arm stand. Yay Santa!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ice. Kent east hill. wawx iceicebaby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kent east hill. Ice on the trees. Not much, so hopefully won't accumulate more. wawx kentwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. NWSSeattle just issued a surprise winter storm warning, for 5 mile east of me. What a difference a little elevation makes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's nothing like 34 degrees and rain to set the tone for the day. Snow would be much more pleasant ... wawx auburnwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so done with 2016. RIP JohnGlenn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just be cautious. If ButtersOK gets really into you, this happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So ButtersOK gets bored some nights, pulls the sock drawer open, and flings socks everywhere. Also important cat work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember: Goat Head sounds nearly identical to Go Ahead and could make you feel slightly better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back from vacation. Mumps outbreak in my city, a looming snow storm, and mom's e-mail account sending 150k+ porn spams from my server.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buy new mattress & bed frame from diff places. Don't worry, says mattress guy. It's always in stock. Except for week after frame delivery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Met new person yesterday. Mentioned that I used to be a dispatcher. New person: Cool! I would have expected more cursing though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really enjoying this NDPTC Climate Adaption Planning for EM, Great instructors in BedardT, therobdale, and jamesburke54,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally could have! I stopped at SBux for tea right before I got here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was last week. Today, I'm here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Oregon. CherylBle, I'm in your hood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate it when places I work do crap like this. phishingtraining really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting up at 0345 to drive to Oregon seemed like a much better idea when I put it on my calendar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not the scba you're looking for ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From quicken: "May I know if you tried to create a new report if the problem is still persist to the new report?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From my quicken live customer service chat: "Thank you. Please hold on the line. You can also grab your coffee while you are waiting."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to regret this live chat with quicken support. They just asked "May I know what is P&L reports?" Um, it's your product.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ever so helpfully, my post on the community forum was archived by a moderator. I guess I'll make a new one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bummer. Tried to buy deadmau5 presale tix for ShowboxPresents and nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I really wonder how people get those jobs. I got lectured by a TSA officer once about how God disapproved of my tattoo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, guess not. Nexus gives same benefit. Only $50 for 5 years. Price triples 1/1 tho I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wierd. Get Global Entry maybe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hubs spent a lot of time in Brazil with his old job. I never went with though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Customs form was so boring they didn't even keep it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I carry hand sanitizer . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was gross. Had to lick my fingers for the Global Entry scanner to read them. Mostly gross for whomever followed me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a really new market with a probable cultural difference. Pretty sure assertive redhead was a new experience. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a little testy when made up rules started being tossed about, but I never crossed the rude threshold. I can tho when needed. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I noted an issue when we checked in, but sent DM and was told all was ok. Not so much. Worked out, but not in the best way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nearly AlaskaAir fail. LIR didn't want to upgrade my companion. Said I was rude when I pointed out that gold75k upgrade applies to both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! Internet sucks in here. Easier to just ask you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any idea when the counter opens at LIR? Assumed 4 hours ahead, but appears not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last few hours in the sun and sand. But it's been a really nice week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So not ready to leave the land of sun. Especially to go back to SeattleSnow. 24 hours left in CostaRica.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I started outline for grad course, but never got to the readings. Happy to share when I'm back in the land of internet. DM me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You probably won't find one. Tech changes too quickly. Better to create a course reader of current journal articles. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Called front desk about bedroom AC broken. Response now up to 4 guys and a ladder. Now I hear a drill. Guessing major repair or replace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So having P&L reports that work correctly is an idea? Seems like it should be a best practice if you want to retain customers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, and they're included, but not pulling the expense data, only credits to the line item.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hockey too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best AlaskaAir arrival greeting ever: welcome to Costa Rica, where the local time is. . . Who Cares??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>0300 is a horrible time to leave for the airport, even if it is for vacation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why most of my donated dollars go to the local food bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So ABThxgSOS is the best thing on Twitter today. FTR, I used the altonbrown turkey brine this year. Bird will go in about 2 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was this dive bar in Vegas. Jar of housemade bacon vodka. Vodka + bacon in a giant jar. Gross, but bacony!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've instituted a Thanksgiving rule for this year. If you want to talk politics or work, you have to do a shot first. Of bacon vodka. yummy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have. Many others have. Nobody has a solution. Which tells me it's a product failure, not a user issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't in the 2016 version. That's why I'm asking. It includes it on the Schedule C report, but not the P&L.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is that a no then on including mileage expenses in the P&L?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is not useful when I'm driving. Still have to use a secondary program. How about including it in P&L which it doesn't in 2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So quicken does you 2017 Home/Biz product include a mileage tracker in the app or include mileage expenses in P&L report?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is supposed to be a vacation, not an episode of survivor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm leaving for vacation in Costa Rica on Saturday. They're supposed to get a hurricane Thursday and Friday. typicalvacation emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uhhhhhhhhhhh. Sounds like somebody needs to be fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brought my mom to a Christmas concert. She has knitting and a curling iron in her bag. Door guy took a look and just waiver her through!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just figured out that Intuit's stupid Quicken Home and Business doesn't include mileage expenses as part of biz P&L. How stupid is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Process without policy = bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This just generates more questions for me! What is the policy on data retention and protection?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could theoretically do that, depending on how long the video is kept and whether a warrant would be required to access it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of it's a public library it may be a legal public record depending on what state you're on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are the logs tied to a user in some way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without more context, yes it is normal to have log files that would include all activity, including websites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would a dog sanctuary have dogs "chained up"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that one was awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best zamboni driver ever. justsayin RockOn hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And just like that, new glass! Not clean though, just new. SeattleTbirds hockey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dittos all around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which holiday though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Affirmation vs information: an excelled post by a KGWNews reporter. Social media produces a LOT of false flags.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. Funniest thing I've read all day. And FTR, I'm one of those left leaning, 2nd amendment loving anomalies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Politicians come & go. Family shouldn't. Don't let politics interfere. Life is too short to let somebody you'll never meet get between you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found somebody who has some great stuff I can use! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody in my circle have drone footage overflying a levy or dam that they would let me use for something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Walgreens mail order pharmacy: please explain why you do this! You could fit an entire year's worth in this monstrosity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alas, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. We lost one of the kindest men in emergency management today. RIP Bob Bohlman. You'll truly be missed. EMlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's equally annoyed by it, so guessing no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe. Sounds more like an "end of cycle" alert for something. But nothing should be doing that right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think so.It would continue to beep. This is a randomly occurring series of 3 beeps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's something randomly beeping in my house. Not a smoke detector beep, but something else. Can't find it. annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all my weather nerds. NDPTC EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems so odd to be reading about Chernobyl again!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Super exciting anniversary dinner: husband is stopping for DairyQueen takeout on his way home. We really know how to party! :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This. 100x this! moooooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I convinced the crows to come eat peanuts with me sitting on the patio. winter birds crows<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhh. likelystory<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yay for football! Boo for Collinsworth. Seahawks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Glad that my feed is filled with hockey angst tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that class? I've been thinking about trying to get in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the REdesign class? Never heard of it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, it's a smile!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I asked that question. They assured me that was not the issue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except maybe why it's taking somebody so long to get our presentation posted?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got anything you want to talk about? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it has been a busy few weeks, what with storms and conferences and such smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is everybody today?? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me to tech support: do you support IMAP? If so, please send server info. Tech Support: What you are you trying to do? Um, duh. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy leading this tabletop exercise keeps using term "geocode". And I keep thinking "I don't think that word means what you think it does".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already talk of one here in WA being replaced before December.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh. Person in the water is a previously armed suspect. Apparently he thought jumping in would make his day better. badchoices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Scanner traffic suggests there's a person in the Green River in auburnwa. That's not a good place to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's adorable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just discovered that my camellia is blooming. In November. In Washington. Surely this is a sign of the end times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since it's illegal to campaign near a polling place and we vote from home in WA, does that make election day robocalls illegal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like being on a video conference praying that your nose doesn't start bleeding again. Ugh.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Making a hot toddy on my AlaskaAir flight, minus the honey. I'm particularly grateful for my upgrade today. GoingHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it stopped, so I'm going with yes on question 1. Air here isn't dry, so no on Q2. Made for an awkward convo with the desk tho!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our PER344 NDPTC course just named their pretend storm SuperStorm Kevin, in honor of the visiting rusnivek.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ouch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not so bad as long as it doesn't hit you in the head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But wingdings I would take as a challenge, to determine what it actually said. This, not so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When your bid solicitation is written in Comic Sans, I sort of don't want to work for you ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to use the excuse of not enough sleep and too many Ja(y)son's! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus most of us love textfiles and his awkwardhugs, so this should all work out. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Videos of interest for ndptc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do love AlaskaAir , so hopefully they'll leave the culture of virginamerica intact! I'm excited to have them in-network.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good morning Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio! MaryJoFly and I are looking forward to a great day of NDPTC SMEM training, in spite of the rain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. I hope that person I just smelled is sitting nowhere near me on this plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 airports in 24 hours. One of them twice. tired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one is a hand talker too, which makes it even worse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate it when speakers with handheld mics hold them at roughly their bellybutton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out the 2 drivers I've flagged in WingzTeam as favorites are married to each other!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And risk my house getting egged again? No thanks! :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>000003:30 is a really horrible time to get up, but it's for a good cause! KCPubHealth SKC Clinic starts this morning! EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After my basic social media talk on Saturday, couple people asked one of the leaders if they could translate what I said to English. Oops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least it was still under warranty ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, but still open!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Share with your networks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess it's time to pour a drink or two and get on with this voting thing ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband got home from store with chips, ice cream, frosted animal cookies. Thinks having boxed mac n cheese for dinner is setting low bar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle area nerds, this is a great opportunity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Official Lead hat acquired. Ready for the Seattle King County Clinic to start! It will be a good but busy 6 days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of big fires in the Puget Sound region tonight. Some with victims. Not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look what came today! AlaskaAir iflyalaska a lot . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI, the amber alert via cell phones failed to broadcast audio three times in a row. Tones only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing glitch. 3 times now ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know,. But that's not getting pushed via IPAWS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Very alarming. Pretty sure amber alert, but no actual message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Third set of EAS tones on the phone with no message. IPAWS FAIL Washington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a second round of tones, no addl audio. Guessing it's an Amber Alert out of Spokane, but IPAWS is failing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My phone just fired off EAS tones with no message and no pop-up. Just tones. Hmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's why I love hockey. Always a loser!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! Seahawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does Chris Collinsworth ever shut up?? SEAHAWKS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or go door-to-door with stamps if you're in a vote-by-mail state<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my dad is going to help coach my niece's middle-school basketball team. His qualifications: he's grandpa and he doesn't scream at kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I nearly died at the first paragraph. I'm on the phone with the same person right now ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the cupcakes Sweet_Themes_1 and SeattleTbirds! My seat neighbors and I are enjoying them! letsgobirds hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're missing an alcoholic beverage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And after all that, I get here and my data is smokin'!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The joy of doing a talk about social media when the presentation site has no Internet and poor/no data access. Did I cap the right screens??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how excited I am over two little pieces of cardstock. Avalanche vs StLouisBlues HouseDivided hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you get answer to this? This is a little dated now, but could point you in the right direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. Facebook Insights seems to be a bit wheezy this morning. Fallout from yesterday or still from their internal "oops"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was probably not supposed to be a public tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a massive DDOS underway though, so you could be caught in that. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mobile is working fine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calendar says Friday. Everything else screams Monday. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's part of the reason it was wierd. I've checked guns before and not had it done this way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a pet ambulance in the Seattle area. You can't call 911 for it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh how I've missed my own bed! And my kitties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe just tell us that's what's going to happen. Solves the problem! And I do like that it was held. Spendy stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't mind, just annoying to have to wait for the belt to stop and then actually think it was missing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird. Because I checked a Pelican case with a lock, AlaskaAir assumed it was a gun, pulled it from the belt, made me show ID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My TripIt wish: put the total miles I've flown this year in the app. You're probably the only who knows the actual number!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flexilady also decided to open my tray table in the bulkhead seat and dropped it on my finger. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New first: lady next to me on plane is super flexible. Nearly touched the luggage bin with her foot while seated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It says AMZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do amazon delivery svcs lack common sense? Put heavy boxes in front of out facing screen door, I can't open the door to get the box!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just lots of MVPs in ATL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What special event is going on in ATL that created a 60 person upgrade list to SEA?? iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! That's the next time it's in Savannah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well Savannah, it was a fun iaem16. See you for iaem19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes! Uber surge pricing in Savannah right now is 4.1x!!! iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sorry for your loss. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uber driver didn't evac for Matthew. Too macho. Recreated hurricane sounds for me, including him squealing like a girl. Hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. Just read the fine print on the baggage fee credit delta gave me. It can't be used to pay other baggage fees, only to buy tix,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I pay bag fees with unused ticket values without incurring a change fee?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Didn't realize that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I booked through you but there's a Delta codeshare on the first leg, should I have to pay for bags?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the one labeled scba on the back . . . iaemetc IAEM16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Iaem16 iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight at iaem16, someone in the IAEMETC said "remember what we were doing at this time last year? Petting HopeDogPickles"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What to do when you don't have a hands-free mic? schuback put it in his iaem16 lanyard! iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basket from my JSUNews alma mater. Go put some raffle tickets in there iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Savannah! iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are TeamRubicon members here, just no booth. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to people on the iaem16 bus this morning. Most happy. Some have forgotten that flexibility is a key piece of EM though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the follow! I did the datasocietyco Kickstarter but sadly h have been too busy to take advantage of it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a very meta photo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And not helping with booth setup!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to convince seeleysue that she had access to one of the greatest things ever in NWHL NYRiveters. She's not convinced! hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be afraid to ask people about their disabilities. You can't learn what people need if you don't talk! iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the funniest things I have ever seen on Twitter! I don't even know what to think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, that's the funniest thing I've seen ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it's implied, it's not applied. Must be explicit about planning for disabilities and access and functional needs. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whole Community panel audience note: Critical to say "access and functional meds" & "disabilities" when addressing whole community. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whole Community panel: be more concerned with the direction you're going than the speed. Change doesn't happen overnight. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on your community and how you define response. Some EMs do field work. Some support from EOC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also for Medical Reserve Corps and other citizen based programs! iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took that training 2 weeks ago. Carry a tourniquet in my backpack now. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whole Community panel: start with one thing and don't be afraid to make mistakes. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whole Community panel: you can't plan for specific groups of people without having their reps at the table. Plan WITH not FOR. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you're curious, there's nothing magical about I5, protecting the east side of it from the effects of cascadia. All toast. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From my adopted hometown, auburn_wa auburnwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tag your tweets man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody deserves and has the right to equal treatment and access, not to have groups relegated to an annex. --@CraigatFEMA iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You do a disservice to your execs when your exercises are scripted. -- CraigatFEMA iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exercises in DC aren't supposed to start until 0900 and be done by 1500. Just like real life. . . -- CraigatFEMA IAEM16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disasters don't come with a briefing book and they don't follow the plan. Exercise to the point of failure. -- CraigatFEMA IAEM16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you raised your hand!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So NWSPortland issued more tornado warnings in one day than the previous 20 years! iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure CraigatFEMA is describing EOCenvy right now. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We explain risk to people in ways that don't make sense. -- CraigatFEMA iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can tag your posts with iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's one of us, talking to his friends. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe his new Twitter handle should be craigthegreat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love having CraigatFEMA at IAEM16. Having a fema admin who started as a local is awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to my home county, kcnews Office of Emergency Management for being awarded a community preparedness award at iaem16 this morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For EMlife and HSEM and IAEM16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I'm awestruck by how smart and passionate my friends are! iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice alliteration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have earplugs I can give you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BC is getting slammed from the sounds of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're wondering where wawind wawx went, check out bcstorm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The noisiest thing to happen at the marriott was a lovely wedding, hours ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It looks yummy! I think I would put roasted green chilies in there though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bad passed us by ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Temp is going down, barometric pressure is going up. That was anticlimactic ...#AuburnWa WAWX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that green chilies at the bottom??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My home weather station recorded a 38 MPH gust. AuburnWA WAWX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can always remote into my home machine, It has the oomph to do anything. Thinking this is pen or Bluethooth issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe not a memory issue. Maybe a pen issues, Keeps crapping out, though new battery,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I think maybe Surface lacks sufficient memory to so this well. Still testing,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some GIS courses there now. Don't know how useful they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The issue was that it brought up a menu, which I filled out. Didn't understand that menu had to stay open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is that googleearth baffles me. I want there to a button to click that will let me draw with my pen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This wedding features all the adorable sappy songs. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing geo based monitoring on the local storm. General sentiment "Nothing is going to happen". wawx SMEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you were wondering, the wedding dress is very poofy and there are rose petals all over the atrium floor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She'd be some sort of miracle then, given her age. She's beyond such frivolity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a wedding in the hotel atrium. Right in front of my balcony and 4 floors down. Music is pretty loud. Wonder how the food is. Hmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a Surface. Need to just install better tools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why doesn't googlemaps have a base layer in mymaps that has city/county boundaries??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No need for a DO when everybody is working! emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep thinking I'm seeing TheOnion stories being retweeted as real. I'm not. They're real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should I feel guilty for finding and using this unsecured wifi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to do live monitoring for as long as I can stay away (I'm east coast). I'm doing keywords and geo radius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it is Cali. They've never been known for common sense ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter needs the angry face emoji like Facebook has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any of my SMEM or VOST friends want to do me a solid tonight and do some geo specific WAWX monitoring?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Badge bling accumulation commencing. iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only about 5 minutes, so it wasn't bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weather station at home went offline. Had to remote in and smack it before the big storm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big shout-out to marriott for providing us uberrides to get to and from iaem16. Makes my nerd heart happy! Also, my feet. iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking for a way to support the local economy at iaem16? They've got you covered!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's my iaem16 tip: don't count on the shuttles if you need to be on time. Waited 30 minutes, got a Lyft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the actual timing of the shuttles to the Marriott? They couldn't tell me and I've been waiting a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly! It's obvious people aren't paying attention to the call. CJSatter and I had this rant yesterday to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The restaurant at my hotel was damaged in the storm. They have a buffet setup in the ballroom tho & the bar is littered with pizza boxes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Savannah is a weird mashup of emergency managers, restoration crews, and disaster relief people. Empty restaurants though. GoEat iaem16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with group mute is when then unmute for questions, chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm participating in a storm planning conference call from a plane, by chatting one of the participants on the ground. I love technology!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we're in an episode of the Twilight Zone,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guy on plane next to me might be watching porn. Turned my head and his phone screen lacked clothing. Luckily first class, so no touching!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You win!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So close, yet so not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who wants to guess what this is?? iaemetc emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting on the floor labeling all my things before I pack them up for iaem16 iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that. Sometimes they have to figure out what's setting them back. Sometimes they never figure it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are both applying the BOOT theory well! I'm headed to IAEM16 tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. But they said CRT, so I thought of video monitors. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do, but then when they turn it on for questions, the whole thing lights up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you on the conference call of rude?? :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that was definitely a loogie. ConferenCallShaming MuteYourPhone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of these sounds really make me wonder what people are actually doing when they're on the call. MuteYourPhone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kills me is that it's clear they're not even listening to the call. They've been called out with specificity and do nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one has both webinar and dial-incapability, not tied to webinar. All regional partners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worse than usual!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the angry woman having a phone argument about CRT standards, MuteYourPhone ConferenceCallShaming EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we need a ConferenceCallShaming hashtag for EMlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heavy rain, big winds coming. Big wind compounded by all the leaves still on the trees. WAWX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now "Whoever is talking about firetrucks, please mute your phone". EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always helpful when somebody uses a name in the background convos. Moderator can call them by name. GregMuteYourPhone EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. Conference call etiquette. People, get it together. Mute your phones!! EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good read for NDPTC and SMEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think maybe this was an internal server issue. It's back up now in any case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely! We will have plenty of time in STL to hangout!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BUT I lied. We're coming to St. Louis for the Winter Classic. So 2 NHL games this year. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colorado! I've been an Avs fan since they were the Nordiques! Hubs has been a Blues fan longer. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to buy plane tix AlaskaAir and website won't load. What's up??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got tix to our one NHL game of the year: StLouisBlues at Avalanche. Hubs will be in the Blues jersey, I'll be in the Avs! hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It typically doesn't show in-building coverage very well. And I've heard "nothing" works in that building.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new housekeeper told me she thought I was 30. I hired her on the spot ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I know anybody in Bellevue(WA) who uses TMobile, ATT, or sprint & could stop by Marriott & check data coverage inside? I wld owe you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, except it's a non-profit I'm part of and the entire reason I'm doing it is because they DON'T get social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing a talk on social media in a couple of weeks. Just found out that the conference isn't paying for internet and no cell signals get in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot how much I hate being mansplained to ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>End of whose life?? Yours or theirs? Was this a prediction on their part? Should I be worried about you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my colleagues mistakenly picked the word "disaster" last time ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey ShoWareCenter and SeattleTbirds, are you aware that strobe lights can trigger both seizures and migraines? NotCool StopIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was literally writing it when the shark scrolled by. Had to delay the post slightly in order to deliver shame!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should totally add the new Glass Animals tune to the SeattleTbirds lineup!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's cuz I wrote it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That image has actually been around a lot longer. Here, I googled it for you:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fake image. No sharks swimming in streets in Jacksonville. This photo has been around for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read this post at the same time that my local news media posted a fake image of a shark in Jacksonville!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe you fell for that. That image has been circulating since 2014. Verify images in Tin Eye or Google Image search!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The moral of this scanner traffic is that you should not set your house alarm when you evacuate. The alarms are hammering 911.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Full house for today's ndptc PER304 smem course in Bozeman. Thanks for hosting SaraFillion and me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really cool info for NDPTC SMEM.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Eh, lots of shadows on the ice at the ends. The effects are cool for non-play though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was officially the lamest SeattleTbirds on-ice promo ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another from tonight's opening ceremony. SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They called in reinforcements. hockey seattle letsgobirds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow. All new lighting in ShoWareCenter for SeattleTbirds. It's nice, but corners are kinda dark.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Descent into Seattle has begun. Yay for home! And almost 45 minutes early. This might be some sort of IAD to SEA record, iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd say cats don't belong at hockey games, but ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have live support that was pretty good. I used it for last weekend's away game.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's why I'm confused. I see Business Elite, but when I check the plane, it has Delta One, Delta Comfort, and Economy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Argh! So close AlaskaAir! I'll get it Friday. mvpgold75k iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love all this travelling trainer stuff. This week in Emmitsburg, I have former students from Santa Barbara and Cordova. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't unsee that .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's missing and "ow" and a couple of expletives!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. I may have dropped the ball on that. I will see if I can fix that tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it when people bitch about their neighbors on nextdoor, forgetting that those very neighbors might be on there too. fireworks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to watch the debate tonight, but then I will have opinions I want to express and HatchAct. It sucks to want to engage but be barred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwwwww, :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI, the smemchat is used for a weekly chat (on Fridays), not for alerts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just give everybody arm floaties!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wasn't my seat! And they did have a seat for the person who's seat it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This turned out to be very fortuitous. The 6C seat just broke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, he's somewhere in the back now, so I probably won't see him again this flight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is a shiny new 737-900.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EMI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair, it's PNW bias. Everybody assumes brown = Hispanic. Used to happen to the Hawaiian who worked for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a rare thing. An oversold AlaskaAir flight. I think I've seen it maybe 3 times ever. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Uber deliveries there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is! Now if I could listen to my preferred audio feed . ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now it's WHLSucks. Livestream has Portland audio (fine) and Ducks postgame video derp letsgobirds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trying to link my Uber and StarwoodBuzz accounts because POINTS. E-mails must match, but neither will let me change mine. annoying<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah, I did. It fixed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My audio feed is still showing PEI, though the Twitter scroll is Charlotte.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally gave up and use Google Calendar and have it sync with all my Outlook clients separately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a domain I've been trying to buy. It's not in use, but it's up on a purchase site. The owner won't respond tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate domain squatters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Indeed! The cats were super excited though that I was fixing the giant water dish ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like starting the day up to your elbows in the toilet tank ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So close. Thought I had it. Missed change in how AmericanAir miles are credited to AlaskaAir. Next week though! iflyalaska mvpgold75k<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't think that's approved footwear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found the right emergency roof repair guy. The second thing he said was "let me check the Doppler on my weather app". EMLife wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh. Monday. Roof leaking. DNS acting super wonky. Much work to do. At least the coffee machine is working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently he's never left a city . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell him I can relate. I had one land on my noise mid-interview once. Luckily not live, so we got to restart! :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love the new Xbox ad featuring beastmode. awesome seahawks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>But social media has changed people's confirmation bias. It' merely exposed what was already there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always hope that there are people watching the civil discourse who are learning from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it depends on the people involved. I have some friends who excel at civil discourse. I have others who don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in the unique position of being banned from "attempting to influence a federal election".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole convo is why I make generous use of the restricted posts feature on FB. Some convos I just can't deal with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for having me today HopeAACR! And thanks for goodie bag. ButtersOK loves the dog food and it's big enough that kitten won't eat it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah. They always had better food and beer up there though. I miss that . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't ponder too hard. Govt budgets can make you go insane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anything general fund, no. Anything enterprise fund, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, those are usually general fund since they don't generate direct revenue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Water generally is, along with the pipes that carry it. Ditto sewer. Toll roads too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Govt agencies do run "enterprise funds" which are areas that are supposed to be self sufficient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that's an IED, it was a big one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of my "neighbors" on nextdoor just posted an "urgent alert" about police princes. I'm wondering if they're wearing crowns or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, but I'm on a plane, wearing my WISP shirt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I give you a bio??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I look forward to seeing you all on Sunday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was going so well until I just found out you have no food on flights after 8 PM. hangry<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Reddit is what the users make of it though. And plenty of rumors get debunked there. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reddit is what you seek! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a great example though of why you should only ever link to original sources, not just the graphics that accompany them. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not misinformation. It's scientifically accurate information. Graphic shows the ETA IF waves are generated. smem tsunami<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's assuming they have a records system. My impression is that it's a cardboard box in a corner ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the future, defcon must be followed by 2 full days of downtime ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I filed a driver trouble report already and got a response. $5 off my next ride, which wasn't really my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made it home!! Filling complaint shortly. Uber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're almost home now and not really safe to bail. He just asked us to confirm what his GPS was instructing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FML this crazy damned uber driver was on the wrong side of the freeway, did a 4 lane dive to sort of make our exit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then Uber car had so much stuff in back that bags didn't fit. Looked like he brought his groceries with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Uber driver got lost getting from the SEA bullpen to the pickup point. Then didn't understand he needed to park.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG seriously, we're giving the uber driver directions because his GPS seems to confuse him. And his car is bitching because a door is ajar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you never hear from me again, it's because I didn't survive the worst Uber ride ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take the kids to r00tzasylum! Kid hackerspace. Took nephew last 2 years, hopefully nieces next year! defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's way too early for waxing philosophical . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for that cheery read!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have only good feelings about AlaskaAir. No airline is perfect, but they are responsive and fix probs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FWIW, I would never trust that smarmy sales dude from Clear with muy biometric data. gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I brought no long pants to defcon. The high at home today <70 degrees. I'm gonna freeze. tacticalerror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was supposed to be projectors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This evening is a good reminder of why I always have emergency rations in my backpack. disorganized chaos hungry<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Presumably she was willing participant tho. There are some events I just avoid and that's one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Book now for Ceasars! Get a total rewards account and they'll probably comp you a couple of nights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We missed you btw!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still this . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we can't have nice things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They haven't. Can't get the projectors to work. So messing with the transcription ppl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm vastly amused that a huge room of defcon can't make the protectors work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm an observer. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice sparkle shoes man. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wouldn't be defcon without some idiot setting off the fire alarm. At least be original people . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other secret is to proofread your (my) tweets . . . defcon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yep, full of money grubbing corporate bandits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know. They banned new with generic message and keep closing my trouble tix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not banned from pokmonGoApp, but don't care about it. Just banned from Ingress.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I had fun playing ingress until NianticLabs decided to terminate my account for mystery TOS reasons. Almost 3 years of fun, just gone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just e-mailed. Local office didn't answer after many, many rings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to try and call the location direct. If that doesn't work, I'll email.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just wish this kind of leveling gave us more powers instead of dwindling ones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 20 minutes on the phone with first your employee, then his supervisor, they can't help me. I have a car with no valid contract.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He just asked me what I wanted him to do about it,.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now he's arguing with me about whether or not I still have the car I picked up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just had to give this goombah on the phone my rental agreement number 5 times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No answer at the rental location phone number either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You also just sent me a receipt for a car I still have. ugh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We tend to just say CERT around here. No CERT team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly! I don't like CERTS. I like CERT Teams. I'm ok with the occasional redundant Team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we suck at enunciating, so maybe we're really all just saying CER Team anyway!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's just a weird story!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some places call CERT Community Emergency Response Training (I know, not correct), so CERT Teams is plural.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I sense an IAEMETC microtalk in the making!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other words, they'll be documented in the chat archive. :) smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should have said are there 24/7. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not? Agencies are there 9-5, providing services. Why not provide all the services, all the time? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen lots of great live streaming come from California agencies! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting thing last night was that the crowd ID'd the person of interest as not a suspect before he even saw himself listed. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My point is that most agencies are barely equipped to understand and use non-streaming SM. How do we equip them for this? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You misunderstand. I'm not seeking control. I'm seeking best practices for how we use it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And arguable, the public probably doesn't really care. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's a lot different. It's one thing to use words to describe a scene. Another to watch it evolve in real-time. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do we best deal with live streaming. We can't stop it, so how do we prepare to utilize it AND deal with consequences? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly new issue we have is the use of live streaming video. Can reveal sensitive info to bad guys, but also provide great intel. SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've been tracking progression. People retweeting orig info instead of updates leads to confusion. was all correct at some point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also speaks to the rapid info flow of SM. Delay in tradituonal media has them tweeting aged info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Multiple PIOs from multiple jurisdictions at play though now. All has been accurate info, just not whole picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn't political though. It's basic human decency (or lack of).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also guy with gun just arrested at protest in PDX.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! Pee where you want, just washyourhands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, but then I realize they have velcro ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a fly in my house, being chased by a kitten. ThisMightEndBadly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But not a funny comedy skit. Like open mic night ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now somebody is having a whole side convo while unmuted ... IHatePhoneConferences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody just hacked up a loogie on this conference call. gross MuteYourPhone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gonna be one of those webinars. Wasn't clear that you had to call in to get audio. And now nobody is muted. Dogs barking, things beeping ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting on the fema webinar, learning how to implement the refreshed NIMS into our training. EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check with the law school nearest you. They often have legal aid available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More like 19 that I'm aware of ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When your dad's poor password gets cracked and your server failsafe fails? Your server sends 66k spams in 4 hours and gets blacklisted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, back here on earth, people are blowing their appendages off with fireworks . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing D&D for the first time. Premade character w/this trait: I use polysyllabic words that convey the impression of erudition. SoMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to break out the traditional 4th of July hoodie. WAwx SeattleSummer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of them are available on the Internet if you search for them. It's really an interesting story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry I missed smemchat today. Reports due!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's one of the saddest things I've ever read. I can't imagine such hate. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This might be my new favorite quote: Alliance of stupidity. Now to work it in to conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems like a very good cause. Every $5 helps. thinblueline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which completely explains why the big "brewers" tout their ice cold beer! swill gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should say "of treatment".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. 30 days or treatment plus 30 day extension, then either "medical review" or 90 day wait. Dr wishes don't matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we just need to find you a friend who works at facebook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe just resubmit every time they deny and hope somebody different gets it! Or maybe there's a blacklist and you're on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird. My articles of incorporation were from 100+ years ago when the town had a totally different name even!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your admins are real people with real people accounts, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My govt one was really, really easy when I did it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is going on in my City right now ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. I'm going to just let HR know so maybe they'll consider a contract with a better provider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm very disappointed in premera's decision to override doctor orders on PT/OT/Rehab. Curtailing costs by denying benefits = losing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad to see this news from LongBeachPD_CA. cc: Eric_Matusak :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tiny little doodletweet time conversion issue just lead to my accepting an 0600 webinar invite! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I missed this when it was live, but that's the town I grew up in. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought I might pay for the neighborhood at Wendys tonight, after I unwrap all these for payment! Cc: CherylBle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the situation resolved itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 minutes or so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. The dreaded "if there's anyone on-board with medical training, please ring your call button". But someone answered, so that's good,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flight attendant just gave everybody lollipops. And silence ensued. Well played AlaskaAir, well played. iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being the nerd I am, I zeroed in straight on the grammar issues ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good news is that AlaskaAir has early morning flights from BWI to LAX, then on to SEA. Hopefully they can put you on 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well poop. Sorry you're stuck. Sorrier still that it's at the "nothing fun to do here" airport in WAS. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bah. Hopefully they're putting you up somewhere. If you want a good laugh, try this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching this, overlaid with Disney fireworks. Kinda freaky!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sitting in Orlando having adult beverages and watching lightning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got stuck at IAD in the plane on the tarmac for 2.5 hours last week. We got free drinks once airborne! iFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See what happens when you unlock your account??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any update?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! That's a new one. At least since it's not wx related they will have to get you a room & food!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2016 may just be the most surreal year of this generation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have BLU_Products phone that serves its intended purpose (cheap burner). I have a simple question tho and they don't ans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a 10K raise over what it used to be. I worked hard to get it reclassed from an admin asst. The EM job there tops at $84k.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woke up to a cockroach on the nightstand next to my head. I left for work. He's still there. I'm sort of over you Florida.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know for sure that MOEinsurance is. Encourages people to heed evacs and puts qualified structure protection firefighters there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting sidenote: some insurers are contracting with 3rd parties to save the homes of their insureds in wildfire areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's actually wildLAND Firefighter if you wan to be proper about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was imagining bull fighters but with, like, squirrels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is a wildlife fighter exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohinem is often good for some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody actual monitor your social media account or do you just push?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I may try to hit ICRC2017 next year. Sounds like my kind of thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can be on-board with non-smoking venues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two days of conference spread over three days, Has had some good years. Always check sched.,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also PIEPC in Washington every April.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BC is just barely international! And I've been to both and they're excellent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always Reno I think, gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GSMCON? ComiCon? DRI?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I notice that you're using the hashtag twice. Only need it there once. They're not case sensitive. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about Copy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a good week! I'm at femacamp remote in FL this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm also in 1A, away from the herds of everything. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw large herds of them in the airport, but none got on my flight! Safe travels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Behold! Nerd sofa has arrived!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I question the wisdom of giving a cat a glass of anything that stains though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for replacing my Aria scale fitbit. The replacement works perfectly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every exercise reveals strengths and weaknesses. CascadiaRising was no exception! I think the AARs will be very good tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me, but not from an SMEM perspective. smemchat CascadiaRising<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't disagree, but it doesn't force people away from the platform, which is sometimes really important. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's because the cat people are more organized. Our furry overlords see to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sort of like that idea, but a lot of what needs to happen for mental health of digitvols needs to be private. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know that ValleyFire has a personal use of social media policy. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also give regular reminders to eat food, take breaks, drink water, etc. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They also interact with people and watch for those exhibiting signs of stress and specifically direct them there. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry for the delay. New sofa just arrived! They create a chat room for decompression and encourage vols to go there. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's my background and that's how I approach it. Trusted agents I can send "vent" texts or DMs to. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: Some of the groups I work with assign someone specifically to monitor mental health of digivols. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! Cats make many things better. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: Seriously, I have a column for catsoftwitter in Tweetdeck and it's right next to all the ugly. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure how, but AlaskaAir shaved 30 minutes off our super late flight. Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not mine, but it trashed the khakis of the guy next to me! It was dripping out of my hair and off my face. It was funny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plane dropped, Like really dropped. Wine stayed put, thus hitting the bulkhead, showering two rows in it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It hasn't been t0o bad, but I'm drinking clear beverages just in case. Red wine and turbulence are a bad combo. AskMeHowIKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure flight path tonight looks more like a giant slalom than a direct route. So many thunderstorms across the country! IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now over Montana. More giant thunderstorms. Flight attendants just sat down and strapped in. GonnaGetBumpy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We did have some condensation inside, but they warned us ahead of time. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somewhere over South Dakota on AlaskaAir watching a phenomenal thunderstorm. The top's gotta be 40K feet and the lightning is constant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our 2.5 hour ground delay has lead to free drinks for everybody. Well done AlaskaAir! iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Red sky at night . . . TweetsFromAPlane iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And seriously, huge thanks to the AlaskaAir flight attendant who gave the idiot next to me some headphones. He was watching YouTube loudly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's some live feed in my timeline from my AlaskaAir flight that's stuck on the tarmac at IAD. Huge lightning!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, just weary travelers. We've been on the plane for 2+ hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LIVE on Periscope: iad storm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LIVE on Periscope: Big storm over iad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LIVE on Periscope: stuck on a plane at IAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LIVE on Periscope: stuck on a plane at IAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ugly. Tornado and baseball sized hail, tho none got to IAD. It's just blocking our path home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, engines spun down more weather rolled in. At least another 30!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's weather. Tho the guy next to me is super annoying. Won't use headphones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey AlaskaAir your app is on crack. We departed the gate, but we're stuck on the tarmac! :P badweather noroute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IAD ground stop and we already boarded the plane. It's gonna be a long night . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He also ordered a sandwich. Also made with bread. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He also declared loudly that he wouldn't eat pasta because too many carbs. Then ordered bisque with bread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude sits in wine bar, knocks menu on floor, bitches about it being trendy, doesn't want wine, doesn't know what tapas are. wrongplacedude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've heard EAS tones close by twice but I can't make out the message and nothing has popped on my phone. Prob t-storms, but still. iad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Washington, DC: you are muggy and gross today. Sincerely, A Northwesterner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They closed it 30 minutes early to hang a banner. Very annoying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crew just got here, so I feel better now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It didn't occur to me that Precheck would be closed and there would only be 1 checkpoint open at SEA Hope I don't miss my AlaskaAir flight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting survey for those in the EM crowd. EMLife HSEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Marleau!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because info is in silo and not shared. And investigation creates no record that can be found during background check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live near a reservation, so it's even more intense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was Ontrac. FedEx and UPS both know to leave stuff on the back porch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear amazon, plz explain to same-day drivers that putting the package against the screen door makes it impossible to open the door! derp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steaming beets in the microwave makes it look like a CSI prop inside! Oops.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sirens = howling neighbor dogs. CityLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And after that, both of them stood on opposite corners of the living room, all poofed up and crazy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been a Soroptimist for 10 years now. Great organization, supporting the lives of women and girls. Join us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm prett literal. I generally only type it of it's true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not scream on the call. Though I did make some sort of noise that was akin to a strange sneeze.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love seeing deer up there! Always seems so peaceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The carnage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's nothing like 30 pounds of ButtersOK careening off your leg at high speed during the middle of a conference call. Ow. lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is excellent to know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing smemchat will be a bit light today, with many of our regulars engaged in CascadiaRising<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP MrHockey, Gordie Howe. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I plan to be that aunt and call my sis tomorrow and find out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My niece doesn't have a phone, which makes this all the more curious. Unless she has an older one w/ wifi only or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was pretty surprised. I'm guessing her mom doesn't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That must be the yeastiest bottle of midnightsunbrew Modern Romance I've ever seen. Still yummy, but looks disturbing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm gonna guess that these things are related .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Checked Snapchat for new connections. Found my 11 year old niece. Hmmmmmm ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought I had an 11 AM conference call tomorrow. It's actually at 7 AM because timezones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canada in the house today at the KCECC. Officially observers, but that lasted about 5 minutes. Now put to work. :P CascadiaRising<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 2 of CascadiaRising for me. Fun times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't teach them. They either do it or not! ButtersOK fetchs sparkle balls. He came up with the idea himself though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's more American than an infomercial though??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And while you're at it, enable two-factor authentication. On everything. IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And enable two factor auth ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, it's my account. Quit tagging me. I'm not the Supreme Court of Justice of Buenos Aires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not in my current job description!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure why you're tagging me, but I'm pretty sure this has nothing to do with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure this is the first exercise I've ever played in that I wasn't involved in planning for. Way more fun this way! CascadiaRising<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*tap* *tap*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do any of your phones currently support call via wifi on the TMobile network?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Link doesn't work right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can call and leave info with dispatch too of that's easiest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't dm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI, we saw this car about 10 minutes prior. Can I DM you some poss pertinent info?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget digitaleve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And one lane of traffic getting through now, i82 WB. carfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a doozie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure we saw this car right before we hit a rest stop. It was at the "pieces falling off" part of its life. i82 carfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suppression nearly complete. i82 carfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least suppression is pretty quick once they get water here. i82 carfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First suppression units on- scene, also feds from Yakima Training Center. i82 carfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guardrail and maybe roadway on fire now. i82 carfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First fire unit on scene from Yakima Training Center. Command vehicle with no suppression capability. Guard rail now burning. i82 carfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a passenger car<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Medic unit, presumably from Ellensburg, now on- scene. i82 carfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've heard 6 small explosions from the car fire. Assumed they were tires until the 6th. That's one too many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I82 Westbound between Yakima and Ellensburg. Watched the whole car burn. WSP and bystanders carried someone away.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our Seattle nerd tribe lost a great member yesterday. Keep on dancing Honora. RIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was referring to legalization as opposed to hiring rules. I'm a Fed contactor in a pot legal state. No pot for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're overrated. Go for metal or alt rock!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His account probably got hacked ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also imagine that with so many states decriminalize and/or legalizing it, the fed will have to reconsider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The exception being if they hold federal contracts or accept federal funds. There's a super fuzzy area there due to fed law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No option to delete. when I went for "other", I got this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmph. AppleSupport seems to make it impossible to delete an account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a global entry photo that looks like death. Then I realized I will probably always look that way when I use the card ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LIke I said, it eventually resolved itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. All the satellite signals were dropping to zero. No weather interference. It finally stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grrrrr. Trying to watch SanJoseSharks vs penguins and DIRECTV signal keeps dropping. I missed the Sharks goal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the SeattleTbirds fans want to thank you for being awesome! You earned this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm always a little baffled when cons of any kind resist a code of conduct. A pro org I'm member of refuses to consider one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every once in a while, I need to fax something. I try to e-mail everything, but some things shouldn't have a digital trail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As long as it's not about spiders ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope you PDX peeps are having fun in today's NDPTC PER304 class! Here are some SMEM vids to entertain you:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The work around is to put them in a Tweetdeck column, then limit your view to whatever content or user you're looking for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That happened before social media came along! The "me" culture does not promote civil discourse. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same thing happens in states though too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess I'm going to let ISO22301 certification via PECB lapse. They sent e-mail ref payment, but system won't allow. Cust svc not helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They want less government in THEIR lives, not OUR lives. That's the key difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning smemchat. I'm on a conference call, so not super engaged on Twitter at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I just see correctly that I can selectively add LDW to certain reservations?? winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're old and construction season has started ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just concluded that this guy social engineered his way into getting companies to pay him big $$$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's not that the training is bad, but so far, it's all stuff I could teach ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to have to get a drink to get through this I think ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This gem from my mandatory infosec training "Your smartphone is really a powerful handheld computer". ShootMeNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda funny that in order to complete my mandatory online security awareness training, I have to enable popups ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pair that with Global Entry and/or NEXUS and you get the KTA and the fast access lane.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hmph sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my guess is that this has nothing to do with privacy and everything to do with $$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool videos related to NDPTC and SMEM on YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even those without money who just have mad coding skills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. Odd to me that they've blocked that, when anybody can build their own tool. Hence IAWACS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's TL/DR -- too long, didn't read :) NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funniest SMEM joke heard (from a firefighter). "I downloaded a cool fire response app called Tinder. It wasn't what I thought". OHinEM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hmph. Want to go get a mani/pedi, but hubby getting emergency root canal right now. Probably going to have to pick him up ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta scoot early today because life. See you all soon! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check your API call limits though. First thing most spammers due is search for people to spam!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, that was it then. Tripped the spammer wire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The YouTube one is still in Beta and is very non-intuitive for the avg user. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, there's NDPTC training coming to PDX this month, including SMEM training! Sign-up now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know Alisha_Beth uses Reddit for monitoring. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried out hangwith. It was meh. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you hit the API limit with a brand new account? Might have triggered the spammer shutdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, don't forget NIMS refresh comments are due by 5/9. smemchat iaemetc smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw a lot of Periscope use by mainstream media during MayDaySea smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, livestreaming has a long way to go, but made big strides in past year. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: Absolutely. I'm a member of VOST that isn't even in my area! Always easier to practice on somebody else's event. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I disagree about Periscope not catching on. It crushed Meerkat and is actively being used. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I like about FB livestream is it saves the broadcast to the page. Easy for people to watch later. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: Also, YouTube has beta live video stream. Seemed not-intuitive though. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q1: What do you anticipate the next "big thing" to be in smem? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also lots of periscope use. Very valuable SA/COP info. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, IAWACS is very cool.Uses some really good algorithms for monitoring. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been really fascinated by the overlap of iot and the wildfire. People watching on the net via their in-home cams as house burns. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's going to be some interesting insights from the Alberta fires (not using the hashtag so as to not clutter the stream). smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I flew over the northern US last night and you could definitely see it in the air.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today was 50k for the year so far!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I get a prize for getting AlaskaAir, AmericanAir, and Delta gate check tags in the same trip? frequentflyers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I want some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We just climbed and are above it now. I suspect we were over the Oregon/Washington border, near Umitilla. I know they had storms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is "poke your eye out with a stir stick" turbulence. Ugh. SomewhereOverMontana<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guessed right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was my first stay, as I'm a Marriott loyalist. Now I'm excited for the big happy family merger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kudos to sheratonhotels for 1) fixing a problem and 2) making 2nd issue right. I love companies that give employees the power to fix stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized it's my 50K mile flight for the year, so cheers to Gold for another year! 75K here I come. :) IflyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It just started, but I'm planning to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My AlaskaAir flight got upgraded last minute. And the pilot referred to the flight attendants as Sky Goddesses. These things please me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I go for the window.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate being first on the upgrade list when there are none available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be there for 40 minutes, so it will be quick!#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So strange to be flying to PDX on my way home. I keep forgetting too, and then being confused about why everybody is talking about Oregon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel bad that my phone died while she was fixing it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My KTA got dropped from the res. Looks like we got it fixed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Finally got through to delta and my phone crashed. Hopefully they call back. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when I swore I would never fly Delta again? Forgot I had connection booked through them. And they're reminding me why I hate them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's usually the little things that make all the difference!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And now there's a live band in the next room. The happy music paired with our somewhat gloomy topic is very strange. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Homeland security conferences: where nobody bats an eye over pictures of bodies and blood to go with breakfast. EMLife hsem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wierd dichotomy this morning. We're in one ballroom,listening to active shooter pres, next room over is a happy vol fundraiser breakfast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially for the folks who had never been around wildfires before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They never actually evac'd so ICP support was never cut. They had a backup site in a nearby county ready to go tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the biggest thing was the constant state of fear. Lead to lack to sleep, high stress, general suckage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It takes a huge emotional toll. One I was one last year where the prev EOC crew nearly got evac'd 3 times. They were friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strange viewpoint from this cybersecurity speaker. Assumes audience knows what a DDOS is, but not a CMS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, we are ham radio operators in this house, but that's not a helpful skill for this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not your fault the audio feed stinks! I just avoided Twitter mostly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the next series, I'm going to have a string an AM antenna out a window or something. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's our year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid internet radio feed is lagged by about 30 seconds, so we just caught up with the 6 second<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Hopefully you don't have to stay long,.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear TheWHL, your website is severely confused. Or SeattleTbirds and Kelowna_Rockets are having an off-book game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully it's a minor concussion and not something worse. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is why I use Tweetdeck with the browser integration. spellcheck<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Final 50/50 take was $12K.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, Jane Fonda seems to be AWOL. I did find Reebok aerobics though. Funny the ones I saw and thought "No, gotta keep"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was that the bow jersey??? I now have no guilt about you giving me the magnet for nothing. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been to NHL games in Canada where the pot was $40K. They LOVE their 50/50 up there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blank ones or used ones? Pretty sure I have a Jane Fonda Yoga tape I could donate to the cause ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They took it off the screen, but the pot was about $20k (which the winner gets half of).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope all the SeattleTbirds fans at the Kelowna_Rockets game are buying 50/50 tickets. Holy cow that'a a HUGE jackpot.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Intel? In the EOC I've only used it in plans, but would have moved that if it were criminal incident. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Intel fits in many places in the org chart. Command staff, general staff, unit leader, branch chief. Whatever works. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might have created confusion with this. I was referring to the SM function in the EOC, not in the ICP. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which situation? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But if other sections report to EOC Manager, this would too if it were it's own section.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're specifically addressing the NIMS refresh and the integration of SMEM into it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for joining us today find_doc! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I liked the flexibility of the Intel branch/SME/Unit/staff position in current NIMS. I view SMEM in similar fashion. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those of us in small shops use it for both though. Not enough space or staff to split it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No extra layer, as teams talk directly to each other. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops! Question of "how" more important than "who". smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it depends on the size and structure of the EOC. Worked for me, but not in other places. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The question of "who" is more important that the question of "who". smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely! Perfect world: SMEM integrated into existing plans, ready for implementation. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People get things tho without understanding the process. I can throw a SMEM job aid to a sewer guy, but ... smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kind of like we have a lead PIO and a team. Somebody needs to be an SME. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Example: was called in as advisor in realtime to tell and EOC WTF they needed. They we found resources to support. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So one useful tool would be "how to do a SMEM needs analysis" for a jurisdiction. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the biggest problems is that tools are purchased based on "cool" not a needs analysis and biz case. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the things typically missing is an SME/key advisor who can help agency figure out their needs. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, and we often lump them together in many ways. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're talking about having an SMEM pool, not just one person, right? SMEMChat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's also OSINT though, which is different than communications. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And our view is limited somewhat by how SMEM works today. The future will bring new and different uses. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the keys is that it has to remain flexible. It will depend on the function its service. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning early smemchat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe he can sing the changes for us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 8 AM. I've already had two conference calls. tgif<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trying out trackingtime for my billable project tracking. Disappointed to find there's no export or PDF support for custom reports.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I literally have to knock the dust off my regalia so I can do the faculty perp walk at JSUNews graduation next week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds exciting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are also several books of case law on emergency response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charges were filed this morning in Flint too, but I'm not clear against who or what exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The answer is yes. Active case in Snohomish County, WA right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charged criminally or civilly? And just charged or also convicted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh-oh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, congrats on the new gig BTW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ask Eric_Matusak about the top hats in DC ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The commercials are fine, so it's definitely the broadcast feed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The feed looks like it's being done from some kid's iPhone. Complete with weird audio ambiance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, suck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey NBCSN what's wrong with your Blues/Blackhawks feed? The FPS has dropped way lower than it should be. nhlplayoffs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Imagine my surprise when my pesky little error message invokes you Alisha_Beth! funwithR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The appropriate answer for this would have been "Yes, we're aware of an outage and we're on it".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey, unrelated question. You have a site somewhere that shows a Twitter feed overlay to ArcGIS?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sentiment broken?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an EMlife throwbackthursday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a yourKarma that I love! It's my secondary though since I already pay for some data on my phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been with TMobile since they were VoiceStream (except for a 1 year break). This is ridiculous though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one has answered my questions. All them are still in play. Most important one though is why my 7 gig plan got capped at 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just read any or all of the 15 previous DMs. No need for me to send yet another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about you read any of the previous 15 DMs first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least the tmobile app works this morning. I can see how much tethered data I'm using. I'm supposed to have 7 gigs. They capped me at 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Woke up to msg from tmobile saying I can't look up my tethered data user because I have a biz plan. I don't have a biz plan. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is one more DM going to do that the previous 10 haven't? Check history before telling me to do what I've already done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hour and a half later, tmobile giving me the silent treatment and still no answer. Sleep now. Escalate tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure I used the last of my tmobile tethered data trying to figure out how much data I'd used. headdesk grumpy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg. Made me change my password because that was magically going to make their app work. It didn't. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been an hour now tmobile. All I want to know is how to find my tethered data usage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So tmobile does not allow you to view your tethered data usage via their web portal. Must use app. Which requires mystery pwd change. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tick, tock, tick, tock TMobile. It's a pretty simple question. Where do I find my tethered data usage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to use the tertiary in Alaska. Unlocked mifi that I can put any SIM. I carry a pay-as-you-go AT&T SIM and a global one from elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess. But how hard can it be to just tell me where to look t up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do I figure out my current tethered data usage? Got the 80% warning, but can't find what current usage is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And today I learned that unlimited data on TMobile does not mean unlimited hotspot data. Good thing I have a secondary mifi. And tertiary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to do a presentation on Sunday. I haven't started putting it together yet. *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ipa!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gross!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How cool is this??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I put all mine on Slideshare and put a QR code to that at the beginning of the presentation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all fairness, Dells pretty much do power down the instant the warranty runs out ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week I'm super grateful for TMobile's unlimited data plan. I'm on a military base all week with NO wifi. Phone is my hotspot. *whew*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. It will be interesting when they start talking about US names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That makes sense. Few seem to understand how it works though, so limited capacity for work arounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would argue tech dependent, not necessary tech savvy. Guess it depends on how you define savvy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so it begins. panamapapers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, data nerds, amazon is looking for one of you:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Counter woman: call this number they'll refund you. Person at number: NO. You chose to spend that. We're keeping it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I paid for change to earlier flight, then they cancelled it. Put me on even later flight than orig (next day).No refund, no help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You might want to check out cutalltheshit hosting. Unique name, seems to be a solid solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine too. Bad customer service, not empowered to help. I stick with AlaskaAir or AmericanAir now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their support has greatly diminished since they got bought. They kept getting my e-mails blocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I changed hosts. That seemed to solve all my problems (including the unanswered trouble tickets).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cute cottage by the lake has a wireless router. But it's dead. Like really, really dead. Luckily I travel with not 1 but 3 hot spots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool! Getting my pilot's license is still on my bucket list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But those have cockpits with doors! And beverage service sometimes. They're more like pond jumpers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some guy just called this MD 80 a puddle jumper. Dude, you've never seen a real puddle jumper! Try a commercial Cessna. Then you can talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one appears to be new! I'm sure the Super 80 I'm connecting to is the opposite of new though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm on an Airbus this morning, which is weird for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed! I too love FallonTonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have been in bed 45 minutes ago. Haven't finished packing ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy for the first, jealous of the second. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an organizer, that really sucks. Why can't chat be available for everybody?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took a trip to Alaska for work and was rewarded with one of the most spectacular days there I've ever had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I laugh everytime this happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took it from Cordova all the way back home to Seattle. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My warranty replacement arrived just in time for my next trip. I missed these a lot! Thanks Parrot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cousin retired from there. Maybe she'll come out of retirement to supervise. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some orgs (like DC Metro) have 24/7 command centers for that stuff. It's a priority and it's funded. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, that kind of stuff. I'm thinking big data kinds of stuff. He who buys the gadget must monitor the data!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They could be, if it's an organizational priority and they're funded/staffed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before I left last job, I was building a synthesis tool in EM that pulled 911 and other data. EM did analysis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So either 1) Anonymous got hacked or 2) It's April Fools and they want people to think they got hacked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I travel with my silk sleep sack. No cooties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way to screw up something that wasn't broken SeaTacAirport. Sending Uber drivers to the bowels of the garage and using no signage is dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's one from Juneau for you AlaskaAir. iflyalaska sunset<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It smelled good! Probably a Cali or MX strawberry, so not much flavor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it's my hand!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn't work here. We don't have those!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the biggest strawberry I've ever seen! @ Little Chapel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just introduced an NDPTC class in earthquake country to the DropCoverSelfie concept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snopes that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I think I somehow triggered an API limit and got locked out by Twitter. It resolved itself eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They aren't yet certified, so there are none scheduled yet. You can watch for them to be available at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever the issue was, it just resolved itself. I can only think I tripped a limit somewhere. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's just so wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, not blocked. Not private. I don't have them muted. I can see their posts, I just can't search for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need some SMEM help. What would prevent me from seeing a specific user in a search? I can see their tweets in my general feed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being confounded by Twitter this morning. Simple search for specific user + specific hashtag. Broken for one user, works for others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had a great time! Be sure to invite us back again. Maybe during fishing season. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We made it out this morning actually. Sitting at ANC until our afternoon flight to Cordova!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm officially a Nyquil commercial now. Ugh.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First flight on Ravn Air about to get underway. Yay for new adventures!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw my first boeing dreamlifter at ANC, but didn't think to take a picture! missedopportunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will say that the Swiss Gear one I used while this one was in the shop had a flatter profile when it was lying flat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Tweetdeck for a browser works exactly the same way, except it adds spellcheck! smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here it is, loaded for travel. It's got like 22 pockets, so lots of organizing room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's horribly early, but I get to fly on this cool AlaskaAir plane! iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the COVRT 18.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have made sure that I do not. I've periodically had to move one away from the computer so I can work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today: Pet cats. Unpack. Have good coffee. Pet cats. Do laundry. Pet cats. Do expenses. Repack. Go to hockey game. Pet Cats. Sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! My 511Tactical replacement bag arrived. Now to put all my stuff back in it before I leave again tomorrow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have flown tens of thousands of miles and have NEVER felt that way. Usually just ineffective and wouldn't find anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Myfirsttweet is also appropriate!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And for advanced uesrs, just $*&^)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But do you have "OUT OF THE WAY BROOKS" behind you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the TBirdsGameday account still active or should I be watching the main SeattleTbirds for play by play?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be eagerly watching the SeattleTbirds TBirdsGameday live tweet the game (from 33K feet) . Don't let me down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the flight attendants at AmericanAir need to understand what constitutes a threat. This is not cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did it initially because spellcheck. I use the Chrome extension too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been doing it that way for a long time. I preferred it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not so much. We did talk about the fact that what happens up there is often deeply personal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate TSA patdowns, but this one was done exceptionally well. I told her so. And her supervisor. And I filled out the comment card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A picture speaks 1000 words. Brussels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh! Thanks, but I'm going to defrost myself by going outside and headed to IAD for my delayed flight home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. smallworld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, but they may have to get an ice pick to help me leave!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You lose cred with me when you claim to have been someplace/done something and I can confirm you didn't. notimpressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you considered partnering with a lounge at IAD? Oh, and congrats (?) on going to 24x7 service!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to call BS on this. Google Maps isn't responsible for failing to verify the job. The contractor is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's possible I might freeze to death in this starbucks store. Geez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Visited udvarhazy airandspace today. Retired Marine aviator sat next to me. Told me he was there visiting HIS plane. cool livinghistory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Waffle House part that is. Not so much the Twitter part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We talk about that example in the new Whole Community class. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's nothing better than flying Alaska to Alaska! Except when it's first class. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My bad. Wasn't the suspect who was alive ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly alive however, given the hospital's interest in the weapon caliber ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So just Google employees taking videos of other Google employees then ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course they are. Because we need one more thing to monitor! smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best quote of this PIO class:If nobody shows up for your JIC, is it just an ICK then? Yes, yes it is. OHinEM EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's past midnight and there are damned geese honking near my window. I guess it beats the toilet that just flushed in the next room. STFU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nepal was a good example of the resiliency of the Internet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should say at femacamp!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Geez. Denver can't catch a break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm teaching public info today at EMI. Been using it for levity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully this is another false alarm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta protect people from falling poop. ForReal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can find him at ThePhoenixJones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes. He has Twitter account too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's a local self-proclaimed superhero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only reason I use BankofAmerica is that they are the AlaskaAir card issuer. Wish Alaska would switch to somebody else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It grew there. It's like a real live tree. manintree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They already had to refuel once!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, and treemacy. ManInTree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now they're staffing up for the non-relaxed ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget firetruckladder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this now. Thins I miss when I'm traveling ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're challenging PDX for the weirdness crown today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Denver Intl Airport just went from bad to worse. 757 inbound with equipment issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an interesting correlation to that observation:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you have something more specific in mind? I'd be interested in playing with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All those analytics books I've been reading are paying off. Learning R is making my head hurt a little tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the user field that should limit it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you're just trying to find all the mentions w/o retweets or what exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If SM being used to coordinate terror, can also be used to hunt terrorists. Good and bad of every form of tech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bugger. Thinking out loud. How to get it from information to actionable intel? It's one thing to know, another to prevent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's nothing wrong with that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh. Now this is interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first people I followed were 'Eric_Holdeman', 'kegill', and 'kegill_uw', according to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attention RealmofHelm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've heard from a few EMs who have experienced confusion in their local communities due to this. iaem EMlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's really unfair. Maybe we need to find some US based sponsors for some of those, just for the US teams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, yes we do! earthquakeearlywarning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. I just got that e-mail too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice mix of class members at this week's E104 and E105 class. It's going to be a great week! EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's my co-instructor! I knew I knew somebody from his county. I just couldn't figure out who!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This popup from wunderground amused me. I'm on a plane of course! tweetsfromaplane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little choppy coming into IAD. All that hot air blowing out of DC I guess ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to Emmitsburg. SEA -> IAD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's so me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nicely done sir, nicely done. wookie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A wedding! Tho some of us are just innocent bystanders. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice! I have whole set. I was really into cards back in the day. I have thousands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had season tickets there when he played there. I think I have one of his team cards and his draft card!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sort of miss the days of real fish being flung on the ice! seattletbirds pdxwinterhawks oldschool hockey letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was going to post the same thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have one right next to is. One in front was wearing a Coach K PDX jersey. oldschool letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packed house tonight for seattletbirds va pdxwinterhawks. Sellout?? letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you considered periscope?? For, ya know, the nerds? nerdwedding emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. asmallorange used to be so responsive to support tickets. Now, not so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The simplest thing about changing hosts should be typing in the new NS records and clicking submit. But not today. Hence the change. ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If somebody guesses your password, because you used a poor one, that's not hacking. That's you being complacent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like multiple monitors. I think it's a throwback to my dispatch days! It seems more orderly to me than everything on one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right?? My new 27" monitor seems too small. Might need a second one . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were playing with that at the last class I taught. It worked, but severe limitations due to screen size!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's really fast in Chrome. One nice feature is that you can login from anywhere and your columns are still there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have FF too. I think there's some function of Blackboard that only works in FF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do use the TweetDeck extension for Chrome. I like it better that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything works better in Chrome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My whole house smells like pot roast. Mmmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I probably just never hit that point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually have always used the web version. I use the Chrome browser extension because spellcheck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More good info: free training headed your way from NDPTC:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want the facts on some common preparedness myths? Follow the SafetyFacts Twitter chat on 3/30 at 2 PM ET. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha! My dad was a subsistence fur trapper when I was a kid. I've seen way more than my fair share! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to miss smemchat this week, but I am going to run an experiment on your tweets when you're done. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As it kid it was always (&*#^ anyway. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I meant depending on where the show was being filmed! If it's in Oz, possum is correct. If it's here, then opossum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depending of where they are (I don't watch that show) it actually could be Possums.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So apparently we'll be spending NYE 2016 in StLouis because NHL winterclassic. When one family member bleeds blue, it's just what you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We just call 'em possums in this part of the country!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pinterest seems determined to convince me that I need to go get another tattoo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for Parrot for making this right! Long flights are much, much better with these on. frequentflyer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you considered adding mileage tracking to the Quicken app? Would make it much more useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've completely misused the title Emergency Manager. Thousands of real EMs do their jobs well every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fine state has a habit of creating laws that clash with federal laws. It's sort of a thing here. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You say that, yet all I get are 3 cat pics and a 1 piece of pie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! I'll DM you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome! I'm going to get wifeoftheyear for this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really?! I'll trade you a Jacobs bobblehead for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We got there late and they were out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw you up there on the big screen with your nose in your phone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think they're the host!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got real flyers I can send you too if that would be helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you promote the Hayden and Spokane classes in your local networks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think my barometer is dead. I'm really not in the mood to crawl around on the garage roof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Android encryption nearly bricks your phone. Encrypted mine and it was very kludgy. Need encryption and usability!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I was supposed to be there this week & have been wrestling with how to differentiate between what I do & what they did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a really important distinction for those of us who are real emergency managers. HSEM SMEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All she has to do is wear a colander on her head. It blocks the signal. MissThatJob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I probably should not have turned on this linkinpark special while I'm trying to grade homework. distracting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love helpful customer service. dnbus set a nice high bar today. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thunder! And all the cats scatter ....#wawx AuburnWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. Laughed until I got dizzy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I laughed so hard at my results on that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's alarming. Hope the dog got an extra ball toss!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. Shorter this year. And horizontal camera rotation. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know! I even dug up the video!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really think we need to start a contest called Truth or Onion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are really no words that adequately describe him or his campaign right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just stumbled across an old website I made. Hubby pointed out that it's older than most people on the Internet .,..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New furnace and heat pump were $$$, but average daily KWH dropped by 47 for last month, compared w/last year. Avg daily temp 1 degree lower!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've also seen an algorithm that spots likely terrorist recruits so they can be intercepted for non-evil purposes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, other people. Hang on for link.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People have written them for Twitter. Same process would work on FB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You bellowing into your phone about travel increasing your stress and anxiety levels isn't comforting to the rest of us. tweetsfromaplane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can loan you my travel spork if you want to go for maximum damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm vaguely amused the exec director of a media organization doesn't know their own twitter handle and tags me instead. notevenclose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not the scba you're looking for ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes me sick. People suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like TheOnion has taken over the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downside of arriving 40 minutes early: no gate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy. 30 minutes early on a westbound flight! More time to spend in the AmericanAir Admiral's Club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a great time. You'll love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Browsing that site just caused me to place a $200 Amazon book order. From a plane. Thanks for that. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to back it. The timing was perfect for something I've been thinking about. I'm taking as a sign! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That looks like a really cool project!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. VPN won't connect,. So much for the work I was going to get done this morning. Guess I'll nap instead. tweetsfromaplane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could be a cool SMEM gig at FEMA, though the pay sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fly-over states are the bounce-over states this morning. Holy turbulence. tweetsfromaplane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why the AlaskaAir cheese and fruit plate is better than AmericanAir's. No walnuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Parrot, this gives me a sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm suspicious of people who order decaf coffee at 6 AM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things waiting for me when I get home: husband, cats, replacement gear bag, new ham radio, good coffee. hurryup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently there's a herd of teenagers staying in this hotel. They're not quiet ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I blew out my favorite power brick on this trip. My phone says that it's connected to a slow USB connection. Time to amazon shop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent yesterday and today in Newark. Flying out of Columbus tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is the craziest thing I've seen in US politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad I'm leaving your fine state in the AM then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally figured out how cool the 3d view was once I shut off privacy badger. oops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It reminds me of the WTO riots in Seattle. Protesters were protesting, but then aholes arrived solely to create riots. scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yowzers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is really cool! Except for the whole "junk in the ocean" bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well good, because Saturday you get to take me home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohio is flat. Very flat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad AmericanAir waited 2 minutes to close that airplane door. whew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude has a privacy screen scotch taped to his laptop screen. classy effective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mixed feelings when my name is in the "hurry up" announcement. Don't like being who everybody is waiting on, but glad plane is still there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We made up some time. About to find out if I make the connection or not. Think I will!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bugger. Sitting on the tarmac in RDU. Ground stop of some sort. Does not bode well for making my AmericanAir DCA to CMH connection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I send a customer your way who's getting crickets from your customer service??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SMEM friends, want to get a little levity for the day? Take this non-intrusive quiz. hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Raleigh, NC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great stuff from our NDPTC colleague MaryJoFly on pre-scripted messages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, where's your public stuff on pre-canned messages?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kicking off a second day of PER304 in Raleigh. And our blessed computer just decided to auto-update and restart! NDPTC RollWithIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got the best comment ever on a post-course eval. What could make the class better? "Cupcakes, because the class was perfect".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I met some of the IDF and Natl police women when I was there for a natl terrorism exercise. Amazing bunch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I followed the thread as I listened! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deployment cam went to NHLCanes game. Not only did it hit the floor w/.2 secs left, but snapped great pics,.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That song has remained in my favorites playlist over many services and devices!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On InternationalWomensDay I wore an NWHL NYRiveters jersey to an NHLCanes game. Because women's pro hockey is a thing now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Repping my rivsnation jersey at tonight's NHLCanes game. Yay for hockey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FWIW, the North Carolina class totally out-tweeted the Texas class today! ndptc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad you could make it! NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're having a great time in the NDPTC class in Raleigh today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there are three NDPTC classes going on today. Two social media, one tornado. Wonder which class will tweet the most??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the old one actually. I tweeted the 2015 earlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I gave them props!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're my favorite example of gamification!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard a new thing today too. "I'm with XXX fire department and my title is Technology Officer". Booyah! NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready for NDPTC PER304 in Raleigh, NC with smweir1. Thanks for hosting us MeredithCollege!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sort of sounds like they still don't have good access to know what they've actually got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Broadcastify feed is split right/left channel. Been a long time since I actually listened to split ear traffic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, that's probably the right track. Could include ppl not old enough to be firefighters too, regardless of gender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know any men who refer to themselves as wives. I do know ppl who wld interested in a support mission who aren't women tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cuz he has enough money to afford being sued??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't that a little sexist for the 21st century??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was having this tool built before I left my job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tech is there. I don't have access to it, but it is there. Basically a geo based cross platform search that plots on a map<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to do with tech because people shut off their geotagging AND don't share publicly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, like who uses what platforms in a specific geographic area?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now about the only one out there is PER 304. Two new ones coming soon from NDPTC though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to wear my NYRiveters jersey to a NHLCanes game tomorrow night. Front row even! hockey nhl rivsnation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are the most pressing researching needs right now in SMEM? i.e. What do you wish you knew but can't find?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially from Creepy McCreeperson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sad thing is that it's not even the name of the terrorist organization. It's an acronym made up by the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, sunshine. (@ Cary, North Carolina)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it paired nicely with the coffee and Bailey's!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely food! iflyalaska firstclass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pancakes! pancakeprinter iflyalaska @ Alaska Airlines Board Room<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have! But watching Badduke fight and Peterson throw water bottles made a fan for life! rockemsockemhockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to have something to transition to being a Seattle fan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It probably doesn't help my case that we were inaugural EVT season tix holders, does it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first hockey game was in Portland in 90 or 91. First season tix were there. Still have a soft spot for them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's with solicitors being allowed in your gas station lots? I don't like being officially accosted while trying to buy gas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of us do. Very much so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was probably the old school "take a rubbing of the card on carbon paper" cab I had to take a couple weeks ago. OldSchool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. Defeats the purpose though. Just wish data breaches happened less often. 3rd in a year for me on this card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. I wish I could get an addl card that I could use for the 25+ auto payments so I wouldn't have to swap every time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The challenge coin tree has been redeployed in the home office. I'm out of space for more coins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually did appreciate it. Barclays sends a text with "reply 1 if valid, 2 if fraud". I replied 2 and went back to sleep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the 0130 text from my bank alerting me to fraud on my account. At least it makes it easy to deal with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I get it when it's a bot. Just seems pointless for a human. It's unlikely that I'm going to reengage in a month old convo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I usually have to go see what I posted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always wonder what prompts people to comment on month old tweets. Social media is supposed to be real-time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wanna see how an IBM WATSON algorithm profiles you? Put your username in the search box. awesome iawacs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a real emergency management professional, I hate that they call this guy an emergency manager. He's not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can share with UtahPIOs that DisasterCTR is bringing lots of free SMEM training to you this summer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it sounded like every trip I've ever had through there! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you in Heathrow??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can only guide the narrative. Control is unachievable and leads to frustration! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully with new people though! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome! We're about wrapped up for the day, but please join us next week! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wasn't a large agency! They knew he could do the work, they just didn't comprehend how good he was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hermanmiller, can you tell me where this part goes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was pretty embarrassing for them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My old dept called out of state for an expert and were referred to one of their own employees! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other piece too is that people are more likely to listen to the "outside expert" even if same msg delivered. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see you're from VanWa though, home of some of the most progressive and successful SMEM work anywhere! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, all the NDPTC social media courses are good and free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So lack of education. What free training have you brought in to educate stakeholders? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What actually prevents you from moving forward with what you want to do? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be the change! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did I not know this?! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've always known we couldn't handle everything. Hard message for politicians to hear/accept/embrace/repeat tho. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. You can monitor YikYak from a desktop with an Android emulator. askmehow smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. But for years we told people "just do what we tell you and you'll be ok. We got this". smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a classic govt point of view though. One that's slowly changing as govt admits "we don't got this". smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is where fleets of loyal followers and volunteers who share posts are critical. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then our messaging needs to change! We have to meet people where they are, not make them come to us. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is that young people are abandoning Twitter and Facebook in droves! We're missing them. SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anybody knows where this part goes on an Aeron chair, please tell me. It just fell off my chair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am. On Sunday for an NDPTC gig. Be there until Thursday morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How close is that to Raleigh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the struggle we were had with Instagram too. Had to set it up on our duty officer iPad and do it manually. SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q1: How are you integrating instagram, snapchat, etc. into your SMEM programs? SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning SMEMChat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a great time teaching CERT at MOEinsurance today. Great to see private sector partners engaged!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey allyrx7, I'm taking your NDPTC CCR course in Washington next month!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay for AlaskaAir upgrades 72 hours in advance! :) IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the goal now should be for people to start requesting messages that are loaded with animal sounds. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's something you don't see every night. Two hat tricks on the same team. Good job SeattleTbirds Barzal and Gropp! whl hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I follow EmrgencyKittens just for cases like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short ones to iaem Bulletin. Longer ones, find journals that print on whatever topic you're writing about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Google Scholar. Have it narrow to free stuff and schools you have friends at!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of those is in your own shop, so you should totally go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! RealmofHelm meow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much better! Had to logout and back in, but now all is well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course as soon as I ended my Periscope broadcast, a huge roll of thunder filled all the sound space!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LIVE on Periscope: holy hail! wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why I love Amazon reason 542: Order a Bluetooth headset at 11 AM, it's on the front porch at 4 PM. In a driving hail storm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And many govts don't understand that discoverable doesn't mean they have to have a physical copy. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of my jobs used to be to erase giant tape reals of recorded radio traffic every 6 months!. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that's hard to do, since there's little uniformity in what agencies are actually called. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Have community leaders near Canandaigua, NY who need to learn about natural hazards? Send them to AWR 310 on 3/1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not the classiest hotel I've ever stayed in. This has been by the elevator door since I got here. trashday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad I have good headphones. That lady in 2C seems to be unaware that she can mute her iPhone while she plays solitaire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear lord in heaven I hate Concur.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The instructions for my teaching location Thursday say "the entrance is in the landfill". Should I be worried? EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be teaching in Connecticut the end of this week. Spent last week in Illinois and the weekend in New York City!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now we're back at SEA, but hubs can't remember where he parked. He's looking for the car now . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am ready to be off this plane. I get to be home for less then 24 hours, then haul back to the east coast. BadPlanning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it looks like I might get to experience real east coast snow later this week. Rental car already upgraded to 4WD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only that I don't want to get any older!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delayed flight. Sitting at EWR listening to a bunch of old people compare notes on deaths and funerals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oof. 75 minutes now. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last time I was on a plane where this happened, a box of fish had gotten jammed in the door. I found that hilarious! IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's never good when the captain comes on the PA in the boarding area. Cargo door jammed. Delayed, but still arriving on-time. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice game tonight celestebrown8. And if you've gotta to take a penalty, I can't think of a better one! Such a fun game!! rivsnation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hockey! nwhl rivnation nyriveters @ Aviator Sports & Events Center<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just ignore the smudges of mystery on it. It looks it played a game, but it didn't! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ready for exciting wknd in NYC, including my first NWHL game: NYRiveters vs BuffaloBeauts. Brought my celestebrown8 jersey all this way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool. I just realized that Marriott rolled over my "extra" nights from last year. That puts me half-way to Gold already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only when somebody requests them. Contact OregonOEM state training officer or andrewjphelps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's on the plane with 14 minutes to spare. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I appreciate the espresso and wifi! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully he makes it through or my EWR wait will be MUCH longer. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the spam. blocked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have any idea why security is so backed up at SEA this morning? Hubby stuck in 1st class lane for 0800 flight to EWR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am! I get to spend 3 hours in the one at EWR this afternoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a good week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad I got my AlaskaAir Board Room membership this year. Chilling in the AmericanAir Admiral's Club in ORD right now. espressomachine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is why I carry superglue. ouch firstaid emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear fitbit, can you please let your app know that 4633 + 2173 = 6805, not 6589? KThanks MathIsNotHard fitbit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is possibly the coolest place I've been in my smem travels. @ Illinois State University<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comm Coordinator at auburn_wa. Cool job, great team, awesome boss. SMEM and PIO responsiblities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the folks who were in the NDPTC course in Normal yesterday, when we lost sound, here's the full Ushahidi video:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't do a deep dive into the topics, but it gives you a good idea of where to start a deep dive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Classes coming to Ballwin and other STL burb later this year. Marion too. Check the NDPTC schedule at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. There are FOUR instructors in this one little city. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting a selfie stick demo in today's NDPTC Social Media Tools and Techniques class. @<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enhanced driver's license will also work. What a pain though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a work-around, but requires 3-weeks advance notice. People slated to attend in January are kinda hosed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FEMA EMI/NFA students from AS, MN, WA, NM, MO, & IL can no longer enter campus w/state issued ID. Must have passport due to RealID. HSEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's very meta!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another great way for NDPTC folks to get more info!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All our new NDPTC cohoorts should join us for SMEMCHAT at 11:30 AM Central time every Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alas no, I'm in Illinois this week, NYC this weekend, and the Connecticut next week. Work keeping me BUSY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the club! AlaskaAir IFlyAlaskaToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite way to start a day of NDPTC PER304 training:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing the NDPTC thing in Normal, IL today. Tarantino4me on-deck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Water and ice tea don't count as disasterdrinks. At least not the way CherylBle does them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wahahahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fitbit Charge HR seems to be EXTREMELY generous in recording. It says I went up 22 flights of stairs today. I remember zero. TechFail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is speaking for the menfolk only. One of us had a disasterdrink Jdlazo Tarantino4me rusnivek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the record, the restaurant survived us. They may have passed a warning around town though! Tarantino4me sct_r rusnivek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, now my stomach hurts! Why is watching other people laugh uncontrollably so damned funny?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today was KissAGingerDay. I guess I should have been paying more attention!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do I get double notifications on my mobile all for every mention??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a snack. Apparently others did not plan so well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could starve to death waiting on your conference call. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, for a larger vehicle. That other one should never have been rented out. Nothing to protect neck in case of crash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I will be looking for a new car. The headrest on this one is installed backwards, making it unsafe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It did, tho I was really looking forward to driving the MKT, which was not in its assigned space. Ended up with a BMW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that avis has such a hard time actually having my car in its assigned space?? TheGreatCarHunt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first plane trip ever was to here, in 1987 I think. Maybe 1988.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little choppy on ORD approach!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to leave early so I can check out my new Board Room membership. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First AlaskaAir flight of the year. upgraded IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like a little freezing rain to get the work week started off. wawx AuburnWA gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I blame gremlins!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't leave us hanging like this!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I prefer not to be addressed as "the". Also, what are you talking about??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome! Would love to see more people! I can send you a real flyer if it would be helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Variations on a theme. dissertaton disaster gender research<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In South Dakota and know somebody interested in SMEM? NDPTC is coming to you next month! Still seats available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>33 degrees and raining. gross wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What, you told RainierOunce you know these two EMs who quit their jobs and looking for trouble to get into??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to be in NYC in a couple of weeks, with time to see a show on Broadway. Any recommendations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: I wouldn't call them cool, but it was interesting to watch the tweets related to the terror threats in Europe. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm awake! I just forget it was Friday. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be rooting for my alma mater JSUGamecockFB next weekend in the FCS championship game. Yay! FCSCocky<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow. That's an amazing picture! I assume he bought everybody ice cream?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, not really. I actually love this laptop. Just crappy wireless card and locked down so you can't easily replace. fixed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It worked!! Now I can install a new wireless card in my Lenovo laptop without the computer revolting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BIOS hack about to get underway. If you don't hear from me for a while, you'll know I failed ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My ConManSeries loot arrived today! fangirl squee ConManSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll arrive early for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally joined AlaskaAir Board Room. IFlyAlaska whenever I can, but this year, many trips to places that require connections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They still sell books! I have three in transit right now. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kind of like that amazon reminds me that I've been a customer since 1997. That's longer than some of you have been alive! EarlyAdopter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This happened at our house! ButtersOK got a new rescued buddy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, this. 100 times this. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're going to broadcast locations on people though, you need to put that in BIG BOLD print in your TOS, not the fine print.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No need. I just disconnected all access between TripIt and LinkedIn. Problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So today I discovered that tripit has been posting my planned trips to LinkedIn. Am 100% certain I didn't connect these accounts! NotCool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lucky for me, the Samsung Note I haven't used in many months has a reset feature when you can't remember the password. Oops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll have to find the story, but one of these pranksters was shot last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not very often you do a BOLO on a police car, but Auburn PD just had one stolen. Last seen NB I-5 @ I-90.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sis and I have been trading the same fruitcake for 19 yrs after I accidentally gave it in a gift basket. My year to hide it in her house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've had one for a couple of years. I don't know if we'll register or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we can't have nice things ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where you going today??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're not watching the wsdot_traffic Festivus AiringofGrievances FestivusGrievances you totally should be. Hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So unhappy about this. End of doc refs ppl who are uncomfortable w/pat downs, but no ref to uncomfortable w/machine. Grrrrr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, no, no, no, no. This is invasive. TSA should teach its employees to do better physical searches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay for the annual AlaskaAir gift giving! Two upgrades now in my account. :) iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely. That's one of those all or none sorts of things! Can't make people reliant on something that's inconsistent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they can be geo specific, yes, good idea. If not, no. Employees should be using public sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use an alternate address for my ha license. I don't want some weirdo showing up at my front door!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No worries. It weird balance of wanting stuff from the govt side but not wanting to provide it on the personal side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus, you asked why anybody would use one of those. So I answered in literal form! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jabber was not the best choice! It has all sorts of issues. It was super clunky to get NWSChat to work on mobile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interestingly, I have a Jabber account because NWSChat used it for mobile access. BlameTheFeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't use ChatSecure! Like I said, I use myWickr for encrypted chat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The older I get, the bigger fan I become of privacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I provided comments from govt perspective. I'm also a drone owner tho and don't like my info public. privacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not? I'm a fan of encrypted everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep and I use myWickr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, except I use an alternate address now ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except that people who value their privacy won't register and nobody will be the wiser. Solves nothing. drones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be an awfully long haul for ValleyFire!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's up with your customer support asmallorange? Ticket in queue for 18 hours w/no response and live chat never gets answered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ended up wearing seahawks hoodie, seattletbirds jersey, and soundersfc scarf to tonight's hockey game. Thanks for color coordinating!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was. And it was yummy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: We got real legit feedback on our organization's plans using SM. Much more meaningful than public meetings where nobody comes! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realized I was missing smemchat. Sorry for being late!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought Google had won the Internet today, but now I think the winner might be wsdot_traffic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The hotel did not turn the heat on in my room in anticipation of my arrival. 56 degrees in here. Brrrrr!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting Thursday I'm home for least a month. I owe lots off people coffee/lunch/drinks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate it when the jerks in the back of the plane fill all the forward overhead space on their way by. Esp when I'm in bulkhead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops. That should have said avis Preferred Plus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is SEA -> OAK. Last trip of year. Achievements unlocked in 2015: AlaskaAir MVP Gold, Avis Preferred, Marriott Silver. Next year, more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome! Thanks. IFlyAlaska BestCustomerService<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My bag arrived, 23 hours after I did. But not lost! Pretty sure that qualifies for an AlaskaAir 20 minute bag guarantee, but forgot to ask!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Large line now at SEA bag claim, all with same issue. Funny that TSA required us to leave our bags unattended and lost them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My bag didn't arrive on my AlaskaAir flight to SEA, but it's because tsa made me leave my bag with them and their belt broke. fail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also, it's in Unincorporated KC, not Seattle. Michelle has details!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey, me too! It's that kind of day I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG the flight delay spammers are annoying! All blocked and reported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This unexplained AmericanAir flight delay is cramping my shopping plans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always find it odd to have to tell a female TSA agent that the "thing" she feels during my patdown is a bra. duh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey look, my tweet got some national love! Tho I would have preferred that my bro's backyard had not disappeared!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure. Hooefully the resolution is high enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This much rain always brings the threat of landslides. I guess their yard had had enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that feeling of helpless that comes from being 2500 miles away from a family member in crises. I lined up help and all, but still ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This hotel HVAC is annoying. When I'm still for too long, it decides the room is unoccupied and shuts the heat off. It's 37 degrees outside!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know the exact address, I'm just not putting it out there for the world! They're packing and getting out right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's Seattle area, if that wasn't clear.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Aid organizations really can't be effective without coordination with locals. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being at a conference in Vegas this week really, truly, makes me appreciate the defcon goons when we're here for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know! I've met, and been drooled on by, many, many of them! cc: RaquelLackey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ShelterBox does not deploy a lot to the United States, mostly because there are a lot of available assets already here. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ShelterBox vols expected to be boots-on-the-ground within 48 hours of getting "the call". iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ShelterBox deploys in 2-person teams, with the intent of rapidly distributing tents to those who need them. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 4 days in outdoor training, those who make it through ShelterBox initial training go to England for 2 weeks for more training. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody can be a nice person for 24 hours. After that, true nature tends to emerge. Some nice, some not so much. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ShelterBox training is very intense and designed to induce stress. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ShelterBox Response team members are Logisticians, Case Workers, Diplomats, and Ambassadors. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ShelterBox has two kinds of volunteers: Ambassadors and Response Team members. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>40 ShelterBox employees in GB, 4 in US. Everybody else is volunteer. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next really big ShelterBox response was 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Deployed twice as many shelters as ever before. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First big ShelterBox response was the 2001 earthquake. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ShelterBox is a British charity, but has 20 affiliate countries, incorporated in those countries for PR and fundraising, iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ShelterBox "box" includes a tent and essential supplies for survival, including stove, kitchen items, and water purification system. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ShelterBox was founded by a Rotary club in Great Britain in 2000. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget: Booth 603!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to watch disaster_dave talk about shelterboxus at iaem15.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pickles is the poster dog for HopeAACR. If somebody says "Do you want Pickles?" in your disaster, think of her, not the food! iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, if you're at iaem15, you should come over to the CTC in Booth 603 and chat! Always looking for new iametc members.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trauma tourists will also show up at your scene. Check credentials, go through proper channels to get legit people and dogs. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"therapy ducks" and a "therapy pig" showed up at recent scenes. Not really trained for the job! iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like other legit teams, qualified crisis response dog teams don't just show up. They come when they're called. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be sure to research qualified crisis dog teams BEFORE you need them. Legit ones will come with their own insurance. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crisis therapy dogs are not always an appropriate asset. Wildfires for instance create unhealthy working environments for them, iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always find it slightly disconcerting to listen to somebody talk about a disaster I responded to. Not in a bad way tho. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The better your relationship with a dog, the more relaxed your interaction with it will be. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some jerk is copying my tweets and passing them off as their own. GetYourOwnTweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HOPE Animal Assisted Crisis Response (@HopeAACR) can be called at any time, by any agency, at no charge. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crisis therapy dog teams work much shorter shifts than humans in disasters. Usually max of 4 hours. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dogs must be trained before being deployed. Must be trained and registered as a therapy team, then extra quals for crisis response. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interactions with animals: our heart rate and blood pressure drop. Makes us less anxious. Helps us focus on the present. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Service dog is focused on the ONE they serve. Crisis dog focuses on everybody. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emotional phases of disaster: Pre-disaster, Impact, Heroic, Honeymoon, Disillusionment, Reconstruction. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some research shows that the longer we're on shift, the more likely we are to think we can just keep going. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disaster stress can lead to impaired judgement and poor decision making. Can also cause compassion fatigue. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crisis stress management activities were activated withing just a few hours of the SR530 landslide happening. Critical element. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q: how do you know you're stressed? A: I use "different" words. *laughter* iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mere presence of a crisis response dog can break down barriers and get people talking. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crisis response dogs require training at both ends of the leash, mostly the human end. Dogs are already trained as therapy dogs. iaem15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know the difference between a service dog, a therapy dog, and a crisis response dog? iaem15<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Census data can provide a lot of insight into your vulnerable populations. IAEM15<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yep. And real-time info is readily accessible via Facebook for those who seek it. We quit relying on FB push long ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of that great engagement is through use of force multipliers, who watch for our messages and share them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could tweet all day in my city and hardly anybody would see it. I get great engagement on FB posts tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really comes down to the comms plan a local agency has made and the research they've done on their audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your original post said EMs were going to quit using FB for breaking news. Different discussion than prep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed, but preparedness is different than breaking news and requires different tactics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We saw this in the rural communities during wildland fires this summer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In communities that are big FB users, people will camp on the agency page to get the latest update.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, but that doesn't matter, since content only gets delivered to about 20% of likes anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, we will if that's what people in our community are using. If people watch our pages for updates, it works.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What's up with all the empty seats in the LAKings arena? Kinda sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new 3-on-3 OT in the NHL is somewhat perplexing when a penalty is thrown in the mix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'll like it too. Just another tool in the toolbox!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that completes this week's edition of SMEMSnooze, er, SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One has to wonder how these things happen ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now I'm trying to learn Slack. A group I'm in is using it, so now I am too! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry. Got interrupted by the phone! I think we might be trying out some periscope stuff from IAEM15 this year for IAEMETC. SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw it used a lot in the ValleyFire in California. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what are we going to talk about today? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning smemchat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking about MarcBurdiss today. Campus emergency manager's nightmare. naushooting smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could really have done without getting a cold right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also evident that local EM and Biz Contunuity practitioners have different experience than state and fed partners. HSEMWomen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pretty obvious that Gen X (and younger) women have had very different workplace experiences than prev generations. HSEMWomen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting comment that women are the minority in hsem. Not my experience. What say you internet? hsemwomen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>42 women gathered to talk about supporting each other in HSEM career field. hsemwomen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the Women in HSEM Leadership forum today. HSEMWomen EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's something I've never seen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't figured out how to search for specific times, only days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Video chat for em365 done. Now off to teach CERT for the evening. Woohoo! emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's your favorite tool for search tweets from a specific timeframe? Not just dates, but times as well. smem iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What did you do now??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New FEMA Certified course: Integrating Whole Community Inclusive Planning into the EM Process. Host for free!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally watched the first 4 episodes of ConManSeries last night. Hilarious! feliciaday perfectly captures being a con volunteer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, that's not via me. I have no idea what that has to do with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine is normally in my pocket, but they don't put pockets in a lot of women's suits. stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like the looks of that. Two pieces that can be used without the holster if needed. Looks thin too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably more effective to put them on beer cans ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Otterbox was super bulky, but it did save me! I'm hoping to find a two-part. Case + holster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Favorite protective cover for your smartphone? smem iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not good at all. 4 fires in 2 hours, all suspicious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was no link<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just give us back the old app, where we could check our BECU accounts and click the button for check photos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One app to rule them all sucks. I just wanted to check my becu accounts and make deposits. Takes 10 steps to find transactions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've wasted enough time on this. Now I'm trying to scan with my desktop scanner. It would have been quicker to drive to the ATM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My arms are tired from waiting for the new becu app to take a photo of my deposit. I hate this new app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 months ago, paid LGUSAMobile to fix my phone. Broken again. Had to break out the BLU_Products emergency backup phone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You've got one of my former college students in that class. Be sure to say hi to her for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm. I never got my ConManSeries codes. I'm feeling very left out! conmanseries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This hotel has a washing machine! My work shirts are now in it! 2 shirts for 4 days in heat and mugginess was not going to work well!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a great for all my CFM friends!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully they'll all be on smemchat on Friday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're learning a lot about social media today! Most of the class has never used Twitter, so this is a first tweet day for many. ndptc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Oregon, you know you have Community Leaders who need to learn about Natural Disasters. Send them to this class!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's exactly the opposite of what that press release says! Check the details. em365<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I use the title Free Agent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah crap. It appears I left my Surface Pro charger on the plane. I have no idea how/where though. I remember unplugging it and bagging it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my Parrot Zik's for blocking noise in-flight. Now if somebody could just create the equivalent for blocking smells ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here in Washington, right about 1 million acres burned, and are still burning. We've never seen anything like it, em365<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Predatory and scammy. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better to get there safely! Pretty sure we're still going to arrive on-time. I'm just spoiled by always being early! iflyalaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a very rare occurrence, my AlaskaAir flight to DCA is leaving late. Apparently we had too much fuel and they are pumping some off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What time are the two DMB sets today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh, I like that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, that's them. We replaced about 1/3 of our emergency food for the City with their stuff. It's pretty tasty. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unrelated to other questions, but do any of you have a replacement for RowFeeder? Apparently it no longer saves to Google sheets. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a really great idea! Let me see if she's be up for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Aunt is a dietitian and former LEPC member. I can reach out to her too! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody brought a bunch of giant, fresh, local peaches into the fire EOC. So yummy! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also try to make sure we have a lot of fruits and veggies free-ranging on the snack table. And plenty of water. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have been working on menus using Thrive foods though. That's for when we can't hire somebody to feed. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My plan is to cater it out or use a local group called the Soup Ladies. They're big on nutritious food! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A8: The step I take is bringing my headphones and finding time to listen to my music. I can create my own calm place that way. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm big on good food too, but sneak my own caffeine in if necessary! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody was on-site. We weren't using any off-site resources, though granted the "site" was the entire county.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem with hall walking is running into other people hall walking and then talking incident stuff. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A6: Also important to remember event anniversarry as time that mental health needs escalate. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A6: we had mental health pros visit the shelters and feeding areas for the public. Separate team visit pro responders and EOC. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ours involved gin, but to each their own. :P smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During recent deployment, I had evening huddle with my team, to talk. All were doing things way outside comfort zone. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A3: SBTaskForce does good job of providing constant reminders of mental health resources and watching for vols in distress. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be interesting to know how many people are utilizing disaster mental health services from OUTSIDE the impact area. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wasn't our number. I think it was RedCrossNW. If there were stats, that's who would have them. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: I was working in somebody else's county recently doing SMEM for fires. We we pushing disaster mental health phone number. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>King County has 130+ languages. Some with no written form. Have found pictographs successfully. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We consider, but complicated due to policies and number of languages. Prefer to partner with leaders of those groups. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our warming and cooling centers are always pet friendly. Had to specify that owner stay too after somebody used as pet daycare! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that makes it less complicated. No "what does your animal do" questioning. Just find a spot! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In San Diego, people opted to stay in animal shelter with their non-service animals (inc comfort animals). smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's why we focus on whole community. Need equal access for all, not just those with disabilities. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some studies on inclusion. Do a Google Scholar search and several pop up. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not soon enough! It's our required tool at work. We have Chrome because we can't reset our HSIN passwords with IE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of the computer clog was that I forgot and used IE. Just switched to Chrome. Much better now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our most successful was our recent fireworks campaign. Before that, it was a picture of my cat. :P smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if you can call it grassroots since it's my job ... :P smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I may have had a case of the mugglies when I was in DC/MD/PA last week! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even that broad. My focus is on my specific city (Auburn). smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're looking more at defensible space and explaining what an interface fire even is. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a historically wet area like ours, "prepare for wildfire" is a particularly hard sell. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had a 20 acre with one house threatened over the weekend. Ended well though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily haven't had one, but we're starting to try to educate our community. prevention smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those of us from the NW though think your regular heat is a heatwave. Plus muggy. Gross!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I need to make friends with a wildfire vost team. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're finally getting some cooler temps in Seattle. Heatwave is at least moderated for now. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not an app. Totally a campaign focus on multiple SMEM platforms. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've not had big one, but this could be our year. 20 acre fire last weekend forced one evac. House saved. lucky smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're essentially introducing idea of interface fires to our community. drought has put us in an unprecedented hazard situation. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is having smem successful wildfire/interface fire prevention messaging? Examples? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning smemchat. Multitasking today, so may not be super attentive!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I found some TillamookCheese ice cream sandwiches in my freezer. I have no idea how they got there, but I intend to eat them!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You misunderstand. We don't use those forms at all. There are far more effective ways to track and pass info in an EOC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not a big fan of forms in my EOC. They're clumsy and tend to get lost.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'll check that one out. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have an old oscientific WMR918. Currently using ambientweather software, but the freeze on lost sensor is bad. wx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. this hardware and software are completely independent. I know I could run other software, I just don't want to guess!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And manual observations are great, if I'm at the location I want to observer. Otherwise, not so much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a full weather station. It's the software that sucks. I'm happy with my station.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, since they notified all, we could all change our master's, making what was stolen useless, even if they did unencrypt it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially when he loses his growler!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For my wx geeks, any recs for home wx station software that doesn't lockup when one sensor loses comms? annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that! Makes a contest to see which class can be funniest. :P ndptc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Agreed. Would only use if we saw big uptick in calls from public to 911 and other numbers looking for info on rumor. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking that malicious posts could create their own incident, unrelated to anything going on in real life. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think part of the dis-info strategy has to be a well educated traditional media. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, if the false info was relevant to my community and needed to be squashed. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning smemchat. I'm late but I'm here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah.Lame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your last post made me laugh! I do know that cat posts can be tedious though. :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Big thanks to FEMARegion10 , hhsgov, polaris_project for todays webinar. Katherine Chon is a great speaker on human trafficking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How to prevent human trafficking during disasters? Identify at-risk populations. Outreach to at-risk pops. Educate responders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Japan earthquake/tsunami: homeless people recruited. Not fed/sheltered properly. Exposed to high radiation levels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haiti Earthquake: children exchanging sex for food and other basic needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurricane Katrina: domestic violence and sex assault in shelters. Pvt agencies trafficked labor workers from Thailand and other places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2004 tsunami: increased reports of sexual violence and physical abuse, forced prostitution, abuse by aid workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 requires actions to limit trafficking post-disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do natural disasters increase vulnerability to human trafficking? Unequal access to opportunities and unequal exposures to risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Traffickers sometimes tattoo or brand their victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lack of awareness by general public contributes to human trafficking issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lack of training for law enforcement, social services, healthcare workers contributes to victim inability to escape trafficking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some evidence shows LGBTQ youth are 5 times more likely to be victims of trafficking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trafficking victims are highly likely to encounter healthcare providers while being trafficked. 88% of domestic sex trafficking survivors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Homeless and runaway youth are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>California study showed up to 80% of child trafficking victims were already part of the child welfare system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Traffickers are purposeful in their recruitment. Looking for people who are disconnected from their support systems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Live tweeting webinar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Large proportion of sex trafficking victims are black, while labor trafficking victims are disproportionately Hispanic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Majority of sex and labor trafficking victims are people of color.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Psych would fall under coercion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>National trafficking hotline accepts calls, texts, emails. 95k+ reports last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heat map of trafficking reports. Many in Region 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trafficking occurs in many places, often right in front of us. May even involve families or partners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purposes of commercial sex work, labor, or services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many myths around human trafficking. It can be foreign or domestic workers. Can involve sex work and labor work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't deny it's importance. I just have to call people for that. Same with pumping my septic tank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wasn't. Now I'm going to write a presentation on how to do it and make you go through it! Still won't be on reddit tho.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The moral of that story is that every VOST team needs at least one hacker. :) smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What's the one thing you do that makes your SMEM world easier? smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You are not the target audience for that class!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I need a friend with their own jet. Common carrier from Las Vegas to Sacramento for a day trip would be much easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would have LOVED that when I was dispatching. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh wait, there are many color options. Some ARE in-stock locally. fieldTrip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, I just want to be able to sit and stand at the same desk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Ikea one is not in-stock at my local store and it has no anticipated stocking date. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That could be a winner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want one that switches from sitting to standing so I can go back and forth. Had them when I was a dispatcher. Love them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We use that brand, tho non-lifting, in our EOC. Didn't even think about them. Cost is a factor, but pain is a bigger one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe we can get suzannefrew to participate. She's got some good recovery info. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't even know what you just said right there. :P smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vaguely related question, but are any of you using a standing desk that you love (or hate)? I need a better home office solution. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey now, don't call me crazy. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is actually. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they don't, I know a place you can take one online and transfer in! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're talking interpersonal comms too, not just technical ones. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of cross over in the skill sets, but different objectives. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see you're at UNT. Talk to the folks in your Emergency Admin and Planning degree program. Might have an elective! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I'm yapping on about the different between crisis communications and public information. :) smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We typically are providing public information about a community crisis and actions to be taken. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we do a poor job though, then it becomes an internal crisis comms issue for our PR folks to deal with. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In EM, we're generally trying to get people to do (or not do) something, rather than telling our side of a story. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crisis comms teaches how to deal with internal situations (recalls, scandals, etc) in orgs. We deal mostly external. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're all in the community. Earthquakes, floods, train derailments, fires, etc. We deal mostly with disasters. SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're typically not reacting to a crisis in our organization, but rather one in our community. disaster smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the EM world, we're using dealing with something that was unexpected and not secret. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Different kinds of crisis require different approaches. Biz and Industry have more opportunity to be proactive. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Chief!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's cool! As a team, we utilize the Joint Information System protocols to ensure one voice/one message. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The organization I work for is an emergency management agency, so yes. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally, I joined SBTaskForce, which is sort of like a VOST. Same basic skillset, different org structure. SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, new person ask a question now. Any question is ok! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My hubby's from Carbondale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like I should know this, but where in So. Ill?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I'll start a convo for SMEMCHAT. Q1: how do you envision your org working with VOSTs and VTCs? (or how are you currently doing so)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Checking in to SMEMCHAT from Seattle(ish), where it's 68 and sunny (at 9:30 AM). It's going to be a beautiful day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready for SMEMCHAT in about 6 minutes. Join the nerds of Emergency Management for some good discussion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for today's finale, I'm teaching CERT tonight! LongDay EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not. Their campus security director is one of my CERT grads. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a resiliency kind of day. Next 3 hours in a Campus Resiliency Pilot Project at Green River College. EMLife<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think it must be an X in Y time thing. I just hit another limit. Giving it a timeout now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now another agent on that plane, having a chat with her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Very cranky lady on this plane. Taking it out on an airline agent, who is on the plane for some reason.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Somebody just asked me a Boolean search question. ndptc HappyHeart NerdTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was told to share this with you .... "A little info on intermediate social media searching techniques."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As it should be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, most sites seem to say about 20%. Interestingly, one study was able to id locations in non-tagged posts about 80% of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody have reliable, current numbers on the % of tweets that are geocoded vs those that aren't? SMEM IAEMETC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I did that. Going to have to tinker some more between sessions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That has nothing to do with me actually. Not sure who you were trying to tag, but it wasn't me!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure this rental car shuttle driver at DFW is crazy. LetMeOffTheBus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love the red eye. SEA to DFW on AlaskaAir for ndptc (@ Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA))<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Word master documents are the devil. ThatIsAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think cnn misunderstands the term "breaking news".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, I know. Looking for HF specifically to the Annapurna base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that group is at a higher camp than Annapurna. Scary though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw that article too btw. Very cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embassy doesn't have anybody at the base camp. :) I'm trying to help friend of a friend track down his daughter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, they're on their anniversary trip to Italy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anyone aware of HF hamradio in/out of Annapurna? Nepal Seeking info on someone who should be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats nnixon379 ! What school did you graduate from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why IFlyAlaska. Already upgraded for Monday's SEA to DFW redeye. Can plan my sleeping in advance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That show makes me laugh! I watch it for the comedic value. And for the delusion quality of the "based on the life of ..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool job opening for my communications friends. F5 is a great place to work (husband and brother are both there).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. Somebody tried to reset my Twitter password this morning. No, it wasn't me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I. Hate. Word. ThatIsAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an ICS400 kind of day! EMlife @ Seatac Fire Station 46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same reason parts of Oregon are in drought. Lack of rain and lack of snow. We have desert here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This day officially gets the blerg stamp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idea of chickenfries is much better then the reality. justsayin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My volunteers rock! CERT EMCOMM hamradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope so, but the lack of public education by radiomatters worries me. PSERN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Breaking in the new patio set. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Some assembly required" is complete. New patio furniture!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With a Saeco espresso machine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They didn't when I took it. I don't think they're good for SMEM practitioners, but I sure wish my mom would use them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cats love watching hockey. Sometimes they chase the puck. That will lead to disaster someday ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why, why is my neighbor's dog HOWLING? It's both funny and annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My conference tweeting always brings me new followers, who usually run away in fear when they see the cat and hockey tweets. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey MissionMgr, thanks for coming to the piepc conference this year! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But only to Canadians! :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, duh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday the IRS got my money. Apparently tomorrow my truck is going to get a significant investment. Never ok when tech says "holy sh*t".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very sobering to watch this presentation and think about the oil trains that chug along 2 blocks from my city hall and EOC. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody ever expects the mega event, so they're never prepared for it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a presentation on the Lac-Megantic Bakken oil fire and explosion. Chilling piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When what they really need to do is make our address information private, except for official use. privacy hamradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eathquake early warning doesn't have access to EAS. New paradigm needed. No time for phone calls and teletypes. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember hair mascara, but from the 80s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earthquake early warning has tried to partner with cell providers, but they're not engaged. Google and Microsoft are tho! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now, Cali gets the bulk of earthquake early warning funds. Need to do better distribution of funds. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President has $5 Million in the perm fed budget to fund earthquake warning. Won't get here tho until continuing resolution era ends. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really love that we use football and public participation to test earthquake warning equipment. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the video of the siesmology lab, where they could see the touchdown on the seismograph before it was on TV. 10 second TV delay. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're watching a video of the Seahawks radio broadcast synched to a seismograph. awesome beastquake piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new eathquake early warning tools were used to measure beastquakes at CenturyLink. Awesome way to draw the public in! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw a motorhome parked along the side of the road out there last weekend. Guessing it's the one on fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's rare for a seismologist to talk to a social scientist at all! Earthquake early warning is breaking down barriers! piepc academichumor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cascadia earthquake early warning build-out is dependant upon funding. More $$ = faster rollout. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Govt agencies are struggling with legal obligation to warn public if they receive earthquake early warning. Experimental program. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cascadia earthquake early warning is building capacity slowly and fine-tuning as they go. Many private and public sector partners. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An M7 earthquake and an M9 look pretty similar on a seismograph when they start. M9 differs in duration. Will end up overwarning. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just for the record, I can definately get under my desk in 7 seconds! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>M3.5 Nisqually quake gave 10 second warning to Seattle. M2.6 in Redmond gave 7 seconds. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serious limitation in Japan was their assumption of never getting anything larger than an M8 earthquake. M9 happened. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya'll are making my Klout score jump up this week. Maybe more free cat food in my future ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cascadia subduction warning off the Oregon/Washington coast could give 30-90 seconds of warning to Seattle. Off Cali, 340 seconds. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early warning goal: get station closer to the quake than the assets you're trying to warn. Less latency, faster telemetry required. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4.0 earthquake in Cle Elum generated 10 seconds of warning in Seattle. Delay due to antiquated equipment near the center, piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Limits to earthquake early warning: data has to move faster than the P wave. Any place too close to the epicenter won't get warning. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/early earthquake warning, trains can be stopped, surgeries paused, cranes lowered, automated systems stopped. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Essentially, sensor detects quake, transmits data to warning center, warning center transmits. All automated. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Description of how earthquake early warning actually works, but it's better with the slide! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody near me smells like cherry menthol cough drops. I better not get sick! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>California systems didn't account for deep earthquakes since they don't generally get them. Had to tweak for PNW use. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I'm really missing my spellcheck today ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cal Tech and UC Berkeley did early work on earthquake early warning. Came up with 3 possible ways to do it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typicaly earthquake analysis occurs within minutes of a quake. Useful, but not for warning. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish I could go, but I'll be in Texas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earthquake early warning in Japan worked. TV, radio, cell phones all got them. They hadn't planned for an M9 event though. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The photos of the Japan M9 earthquake are so unnerving when you think about the same event occuring here. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>West Coast earthquake early warning is prototype for nation. Includes PNW and California. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Northern California, British Columbia have unique shared threat. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>14% probability of Cascadia M9 earthquake in next 50 years. 25-40% for M8-M8.5 for Southern Cascdia in same time frame. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>340 year recurrence time for M8 or larger quakes in Cascadia subduction zone. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last 10000 year history of earthquakes in PNW shows 20 M9 events and 20 M8-M8.5 events. That's a lot of big quakes. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I saw those right as posted that. I laughed! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Washington earthquake early warning is focused on subduction zone quakes. Most good for the most people. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're following my piepc tweets, you can follow the organization at piepc. I've served with them for 10 years now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scary amount of Seattle is built on fill that used to be water. Will liquify in earthquake. Compounded by soil aplification. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steele: plate techtonics are pushing us up cozy to Canada. Not a bad place to get cozy with. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They weren't volunteers. They were student employees. Dispatchers, campus security, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now up: Earthquake Early Warning with Bill Steele. Most exciting advancement of my EM career! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of the campus responders to the SPU shooting were young students. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fire/medic response was prepped for far more casualties than actually occured. smallmiracles piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Students locked down, pulled blinds, armed themselves with whatever they could find to protect themselves. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 minute and 53 seconds after first shot, shooter was neutralized. That's amazing. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SPU had former employee show up during shooting and go back to work. Needed all the help they could get. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard the first 911 call from the Seattle Pacific Univ shooting. Good reminder of how hard the 911 job is. 911week piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah! A delegation all the way from China joined us today for the piepc conference. Officially furthest attendees ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Click the link and find out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's almost reception time! Don't forget to visit the vendors and mingle with new friends at 4:30 PM. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NWS can also use HYSPLIT to do near real-time plume modeling for first responders and EM. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First responders and emergency managers can get immediate on-the-phone spot forecasts from NWS office for life safety events. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've developed an annoying "um" when speaking in front of people. Where did that come from? GettingOld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I definately would not have looked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was almost afraid to look at that photo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NOAA Weather Radio is the easy way to make sure public gets all-hazards alerts. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NWS provides a lot of tools that are free to local emergency managers. Apps, chats, etc. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NWS weather warning system has three pieces: Detection/Warning, Dissemunation, Response. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've read many! That's why I took exception to the blanket claim that "people panic in disasters".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now up: Partners in Weather Preparedness. Or as wel like to call it "Weather with Ted". piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe for some, but panic denotes a loss of rational thought. Most still thinking rationally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have many good pics of Pickles back at my office! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really doesn't. Panic is a different response than doing what you think you need to do to live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish hootsuite for Android had spellcheck ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Key to successfull business continuty plan is employee preparedness. Can't recover if you don't have employees. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Business continuity plans are not required by OSHA or WA State. They are a good idea though. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Triple 3 Resilience Target:Emergency needs=3 days, Immediate needs = 3 weeks. Full service = 3 years. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PETS Act requires jurisdictions to have a pet sheltering plan. Good to have a personal backup, but jurisdiction has a role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry you have to leave so soon! You would have love the PNW Disaster Divas dinner tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Speaker just said people panic in an emergency. Research shows otherwise. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chrome fixes many things! I wish we could use it at work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quit spying on me. It's the only power outlet in the room!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't fight reality in your planning. Need to understand how people act and react. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Know your business. Have to know what you're about before you can create a business continuty plan. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scba: Scot McQueen and Wayne Adams from GeoEngineers are presenting about Planning for Disaster Response and Business Continuity. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lunch is over! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did curriculum for several years and we've had a variety of crisis comms speakers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lunch time for piepc. Expect a lack of tweets for a little bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goal: find somebody at piepc who looks 5 years your junior or senior. Ask them their biggest fears, goals, scariest moments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's cyclical. Some years we have them coming out our ears! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do we address these future issues? Start the conversations. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, 2005, when everybody was getting command vehicles. Never got around to the command vehicle rodeo though! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Audience comment: Baby boomers had a large middle class. Gen X has a shrinking middle-class. Millennials may have no middle-class. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another reason 1-person shops suck. No institutional knowledge to pass down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vastly entertaining discussion of generational stereotypes. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pretty awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gen X and Millenials often undervalue the historical perspective of baby boomers. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boomers are just as tech savvy, but they must see a value and benefit to learning it. Time more valuable to them. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"How many baby boomers in the room thinking 'I'm too hold for this sh*t"?. Much laughter. Thanks Mdeyerin piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a biohacked person in the room. I'm super dissappointed by the eye rolling and sighing of a segment of the crowd. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And some people forget that tech is more than comms!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you sure you don't want to join iaem Emerging Tech Caucus? We could use you! iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My assumption is that we build out as much tech as possible, then use what survives or can be rebuilt quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But much of tech will, either directly or indirectly. Last seesion talked about loss of ham radio due to pissing match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We (EM) hold a significant responsiblity for fixing society when tech breaks or has unintended consequences. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deyerin: Need to consider both the positive and negative impacts of technology. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I recognize that room! Happy telecommunictions week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advancements in technology are rapidly exceeding our ability to predict their impacts. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disruptive Tech:something that helps create a new market and value network, and in the process disrupts and existing market/network. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More disruptive tech: bitcoin, 3d printing, nanotech, electric vehicles. Many others. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exciting tech mentioned: earthquake early warning, drones, Lidar, social media, simulations, Internet, virtual reality, robotics. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disruptive Technology: changes the landscape in exciting and challenging ways. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>De Pombal took advantage of the incident to improve building standards and convince people that "acts of God" can be controlled. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quote: "we bury the dead and care for the living" came from Marques de Pombal in response to earthquake/tsunami/fire in Portugal. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deyerin: How tech, economy, politics, generational shift are influencing rapid evolution in EM. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. I've known MDeyerin since I started in EM in Washington. Always a good presenter! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now up: MDeyerin to talk about Future Shock! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: EM is all about relationships. Need to have as many in advance as possible. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: Resource ordering needs to have a process and you need to stick to it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: "who is in charge"needs to be worked out ahead of time. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: lack of command depth was an issue. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are presentations for all of them. They may be for paying attendees only at this point, but I can get you a copy of this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: You order it, you pay for it. Have a good system in place for order resources. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: logistics of who gets what dontations is complex and needs to be planned for. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: Hundreds of burned cattle became public health emergency. Able to remove from private property. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor burned baby bear photos. Many "ahhhs" from the crowd. "Cinder" will be released back to the wild soon tho. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: 90% of disaster donations will be junk. Used underwear, high heels, bags of rags not useful. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big shout outs to Southern Baptists, Soup Ladies, and WSART from Miller for Carlton Complex fires. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: working with established volunteer groups will be a big help. They've been there and done that. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: people will show up to help. They need a task, food, bathrooms, etc. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mute your phone people! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: train people how to treat others under pressure. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: Abusive treatment is never justified. Collateral damage is never acceptable in the EM world. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: Great leaders treat people with dignity and respect at all times. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Avg age of my team has probably dropped 20 years in the past 9. Very engaged group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: people handling is huge in an incident. Morale and stress are killers. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's starting to shift back a bit though. Preppers and geeks are finding a great tool for various things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You might be shocked by ham radio though. I did a testing session last year for 300ish, avg age 30.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a tool in the box though. In this case, it was a secondary or tertiary fallback. All else failed too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: the ham radio system in this fire failed due to people programs, not equipment failures. Lost comms w/critical area. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: active rumor management is essential to response. Particularly on social media. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: use all poss communications pathways. Neighbors/phone trees/EAS/ENS/Door-to-door/Radio/TV/Social Media/meetings/trap lines. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: People expect to be made whole after a disaster, but that is never realistic. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, but locals who pay into a seperate entity sometimes forget that they still have responsibility. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: Citizens have very high expectations of government that we often cannot meet. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: Lots of people potentially in charge. Must define who does what in advance. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: emergencies start and end locally. Local agencies must recognize their role and plan/train for it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: local cities must have a designated Emergency Manager and a plan. Need to function alone even when part of a shared entity. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: your briefing rooms need conference call capability. Huddling around somebody's cell phone with the speaker on doesn't work. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: you can't put everything in one room. Don't co-locate EOC/call center/lunch room/policy rooms. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: Also needed a lot more people to rotated through EOC. Needed outside IMT team. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: EOC in ops capacity required depth of ICS training (300 + 400) plus experience. Not enough people qualified. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: IMTs were focused on firefighting. EOC had an ops function, not just support. Evacs, water checks, feeding, all done by EOC. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miller: The EOC takes on a much larger role in big disaster. It requires more people, stuff, and info than you ever imagined, piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! But he killed it with too many water bowl dunks. New one got stolen from mailbox. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! ButtersOK mis-tweets things too. Better then accidentally breaking things tho. LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Iaem15 will be in Vegas in November.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fired up my pay-as-you-go mi-fi and it's working fine. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like solving problems with shear volumes of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now some love from sct_r and TheRedElm for VirtualEMA, a gathering place for virtual EM operations. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only thing preventing me from signing up RIGHT NOW is my inability to remember my Skype user name. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I probably will, but always like to talk to real people who are involved first. Joined another group that didn't go well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As are we all ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not at my TweetDeck. I'm mobile. However, it did NOT generate a notification in hootsuite but it DID in twitter for IOS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you enjoy it? Looking for something to volunteer my time for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I think TweetDeck just gets clogged. I tend to leave mine open for days and then it gets cranky, :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was supposed to be, but mine was still struggling. So I bailed. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It did yesterday. Close and reopen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I have any friends who volunteer with SBTaskForce?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay for att pay as you go mi-fi today. I'm now able to tweet along with the rest of the class. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey bbdd333, sct_r and theredelm are talking about you at piepc. Apparently your the strong silent type. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In room internet is saturated and painfully slow. Tomorrow I will fire up my mi-fi with a couple days worth of data. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to watch TheRedElm and sct_r present about VOST at PIEPC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will be tweeting from and about piepc for the next couple of days. Be prepared! PIEPC EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the website that will plot your personal social media locations on a map? smem brainfart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And potentially attacked by a cat as it prints<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can bring printed things. What do you need?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oopsie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also eco_luna RaejeanKreel ns7c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is a VOSTie like a bestie??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's sort of funny, since I taught a social media class on their campus a month ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I posted direct links to each one as well. More useful than then one that says "contact us for info". :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I'm done now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool! Hopefully somebody will get back to me on my request for a speaker too. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. It's mostly just a boring hunk of metal at this point ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocking that he could claim anything at all! That's a pro for sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I learned that hangwith is not a good option for smem use. Limit is 15 minute broadcast unless you are verified. Most of us aren't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you know that smemchat happens on Fridays at 12:30 PM EDT?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not a camera. And the speaker is remote. I moved it closer to her. Hopefully that will help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice shout out to EFF during the IAEMETC cyber security presentation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's not a bobcat! It's a cougar with a stumpy tail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has been a very interesting experience. pita<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Up next: Cyber Security with Alisha_Beth. IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if King County has them though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now up: LarzWaltz talking about Virtual EOCs. IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New link for post-lunch iaemetc sessions:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lunch break for iaemetc. We will reconvene at 1:30 PDT.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Are you able to hear the audio ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. Second lockup and hard reboot of tablet using hangwith. Going to call this experiment a fail. IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can try that, but don't really want to expose my user info to the world. Will tinker on break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First hangwith limitation found. 15 minute broadcast limit for unverified users. IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhhh. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I take it the audio is ok??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. Tablet completely locked up during that last hangwith live stream. Had to hard reset. That's why this is an experiment! IAEMETC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Intro, history, overview of iaemetc iaem alisha_beth w/scba21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure how the audio will work out, but we're giving it a shot. Each session will be archived in my hangwith account. IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I will be streaming the iaem Emerging Technology Caucus midyear gathering. Each session will have a new live link. IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fixed that. Hang on and let me put up one more test to make sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Links go dead when the feed ends. There will be more soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Test brosdcast w/scba21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh. Oops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I looked away. What did I miss??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow I'll be live streaming the iaem Emerging Tech Caucus mid-year meeting using hangwith. IAEMETC crossedfingers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an abandoned account. Twitter might help you take it over or have it closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well then I'll quit looking for it! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I'm using Chrome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interestingly now I've gotten some to work. I'll keep tinkering before we try to use it Sunday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've poked around and can't see any live streams from my computer using the links in Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, vertical orientation only? No way to force horizontal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I'm saying is that some people can't view the stream. Me for instance. The screenshot is black with a white "play" arrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I'm going to call that a success then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/scba21 Live hangwith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you view it live or the recording though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is that not everybody can see it live for some reason. I can't go to another machine in my house and see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn't actually eat it. He just licks and chews on it. I figured it would make a good sound check!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it seems to broadcast, but I can't view it using any other devices. Any suggestions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/scba21 Live hangwith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Test 6. with cats (@ButtersOK) and sound. w/scba21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, worked is relative! I'm recharging things and will try again in a bit :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's unfortunate, because ButtersOK ran right up to it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, black screen on my end. Recharging devices now and will try again later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Test 5 with cats and sound. w/scba21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Test 4 with sound. w/scba21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I killed the stream, so no biggie. I'm tinkering right now. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what I got too on my PC. I wonder why some can see and some can't. Hmmmm. ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I was being silent! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please click and see if you can view the stream smemchat w/scba21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, figured it out. it just didn't tweet the info the first time for some reason. Worked the second time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, well test 2 with hangwith worked more or less like I expected. Not sure what went wrong the first time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Test 2. w/scba21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Appears that hangwith requires people to follow each other in order to view broadcast. That's not going to work for iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good chat people! Have a great weekend. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IAEMETC SMEMCHAT experiment w/scba21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're more likely to find rural areas using Facebook, if they're using SM at all. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stream, I'm going to try to stream the event, not steam it! :P smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm actually going to try to steam the IAEMETC mid-year meeting on Sunday using hangwith. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're going to have a presentation about live streaming during an upcoming IAEMETC meeting. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have SM specific training for ham radio vols who want to do SM. Not all do both. SM is subset of team. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh, no. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget that iaem is accepting SMEM articles until the end of today for the upcoming Bulletin. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: I monitor a list I created of local news agencies. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Image is everything. Plus, people might look up those personal accounts as well. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would never give a vol like that access to post on my behalf. Monitoring only, via their own accounts. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the reasons I use the TweetDeck extension in Chrome is that my spell check works right. :) smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can also look at only the geotagged ones, that that will limit what you see. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's where a tool like TwitterFall comes in handy. You can throttle the speed. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I treat it same as I would our phone bank. We have an FAQ for an incident. Vols can give out the info via phone or SM. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For starters, I exclude all retweets. Drastically reduces the number of things to sort through. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: I also use a small subset of volunteers to reply to questions using our official accounts. Highly trained tho. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: I use my ham radio people to do smem monitoring. No access to official accounts needed. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't assume your volunteers must have access to your accounts to help you though. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q1: How are you utilizing volunteers to support your SMEM efforts? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning SMEMCHAT. What shall we talk about today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. Successful degrees programs need to incorporate internships for those not already employed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, it's my day off. Duty officer phone won't stop honking ... EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And experience can't replace education. They are complementary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like difficult, but correct, call. I've been on a LIH to LAX flight with a med pass med emer. scary NoOptions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I should login to Twitter directly from time to time to see whats new!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just found the translate feature in the hootsuite iPad app. Endless possibilities! Has anybody used it? smem iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today theres an actual duck quacking outside. Thats far better than the duck ringtone that somebody always forgets to turn off. EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of my EM girlfriends and I are going to go be big damn heroes tomorrow . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sense shenanigans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can see from the slide which brand that it. I totally understand your pain. On every level. You have my symphathies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all hope you will find more hockey sucess. You were a leader here and we hope to see you play elsewhere someday! :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ugh. I can hear small children shrieking and running in the shared hallway. I'm afraid to go out there ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good chat people! I gotta go back to work and log out of TweetDeck before smoke starts pouring out of this laptop. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there sort of is. You can use an android emulator on a PC or MAC and spoof your GPS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've found Facebook to be pretty popular in rural areas. SM is adopted, just not Twitter. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new CERT class has active duty military, a grandma/grandson duo, business, industry, and a federal data nerd. WholeCommunity EMLife<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This dinosaur work computer really hates Tweetdeck. ugh ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some places already do. Was talking to someone yesterday who had psych eval for vol firefighter gig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. Scars on fingers mess things up! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"fun" is one word for it .... :P smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a perfect world, we'd use biometrics for access. I have a safe at home that opens to fingerprints. My devices don't though. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had emp once who wrote all passwords and door codes on sticky on back of ID badge. Lost the badge. expensive DoNotDoThat smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep all my passwords on an app, which is accessible without Internet access. But don't violate agency policy! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important part is to research and be comfortable with whatever 3rd party apps you use, whether for SMEM or passwords. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Noon PDT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like that "share" feature on some of those encrypted password apps. Let's me share certain passwords with specific people. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is $12/yr for cross platform use. I think if you just use the app it's free. Best $12 I spend tho! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HSIN is the bane of my password existence. Incompatible browser at work, so have to change from home. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really like LastPass for encrypted password management. Cross platform, will generate strong passwords, low risk of compromise. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use unfollowme to ditch dead accounts I'm following. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My life is better with 3rd party Twitter apps and password management. RiskVsReward smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use LastPass for password management. Have friends who like others. Key is to use one that is encrypted. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm selective about the ones I use and will often deauthorize something as soon as I'm done with it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Routinely changing your password and manually reauthorizing third party apps is a good security measure. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use several. I think the auto tweet thing is pretty narcissistic. I use them to measure reach, and to ditch dead accounts. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which twitter monitoring services? I use several things to monitor Twitter, so need specifics. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning smemchat. Checking in from my work computer, which does not really like TweetDeck ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm too irresponsible for a dog. We have ButtersOK and one other cat. Down from 4 to 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just one question: cats or dogs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friday "off": chiropractor, gas station, twitter chat, taxes, contract signatures, personal trainer, massage, hockey game. whew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've not yet interacted, but based on your twitter bio, I'm pretty sure we're already friends! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most entertaining thing right now about hangwith is their struggle for server capacity. LoveBeta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what got my attention. I was invited to a private viewing thing and it actually appears to be private.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems pretty easy to use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using it as a pull right now. Haven't investigated the push part yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm distracted today checking out a new app called hangwith. I'm using it for something unrelated, but can see some smemchat use potential<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. If you consider it to be "the only way", it's going to fail. It's a tool and esp in EOC, needs some modifications. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I take ICS as a guideline. Plug and play what you need, where you need. My SMEM monitors sit between PIO and Plans. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree! It's much simpler and easier to connect with them on Twitter than on NWSChat. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those companies will mostly get you fake followers. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice! Now repost that with the hashtag and share your good work! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody want to share and SMEM success story? smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Going to be late to smemchat today, if I make it at all. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Corporate temper tantrums are a really good indicator that it's time to replace Verizon with a grownup company!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This day off is really not much like a day off at all, except I'm wearing slippers. And occasionally being interrupted by a cat. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the things you can use, other than a hashtag collector, is something like Backupify. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And geosearching is different for every platform. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important to note that printed instructions are probably obsolete as soon as they're printed! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Login to your account to check the e-mail address. It was sent to all members and was in the Dispatch too I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's about SMEM monitoring from Napa Quake. Being recorded and will be available for all soon. iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was sent out by iaem via e-mail and is on their website. You could probably register quick and still catch part of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was an iaem members only webinar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the usual cast of smemchat chatterboxes is on a webinar right now, so it's pretty quiet here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's so cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's one of the reasons we're using our own dashboard, created in GIS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, time to tune in to the iaemetc webinar. Will try to keep up with smemchat too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oddly, the Rowfeeder Twitter accounts appears to be mostly deceased ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you were using a GIS dashboard, I could point you to some resources. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the record, I'm sad about TheRealNimoy passing away this morning. LLAP RIPNimoy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The downside to RowFeeder is that is seems to ignore posts that have the hashtag at the very beginning. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use RowFeeder for basic free hashtag tracking. Integrates with Google Docs. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, got it. Hashtag metrics. There are some really cool, free tools for that. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had mine for 20 years! And I'm a VE. hamradio smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was. When I finally figured out what everybody was gassing on about, the first thing I read said Tumblr. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you be more specific? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every platform has potential to be controversial. Same stuff everywhere. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's no excuse! Get a Gogo account. SMEMCHAT from 30K feet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not all served by agencies. That's why it's important to reach out and find out. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to go to "them", not expect "them" to come to us. That's what accessibility is. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important to reach out, see how they expect to receive info, then provide it that way. May not be an SM solution. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think sometimes EMs hear "OMG, more work. I can't do it all." and get defensive instead of looking for easy solutions. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Became clear yesterday that not all EM understand that. "we have TDD and they can use 711" was a limiting statement! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If nobody knows its there, or isn't using SMEM, then it won't reach the audience you think it will. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do, but only if an agency is using it and the community expects to find it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would agree except yesterday. EM said "deaf can do x to get our info" and deaf person said "give it to us direct, no hoops".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like AltusOk is ganging up on smemchat today. How many of you are there?? :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So opt in services as opposed to SMEM then? SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well good afternoon then NDPTC people from SMEMCHAT. Which location?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed, that's what prompted my musing. Seemed there were different expectations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just pondering whether there's a disconnect between what the deaf/hard of hearing expects and what EM thinks they expect. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q1.a: Have you reached out to local deaf/hard of hearing community to see what their expectations are? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q1.a: For those efforting to reach the deaf/hard of hearing people, have you reached out to your local population to see what they expect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just thinking about that makes me cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q1: How is your agency using SMEM to engage the deaf and hard of hearing community? smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh dear god. 2 year old just flung his dirty diaper in the plane, not once but twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Seat neighbor is about 2 and is already getting an in-seat diaper change. We haven't even closed the door yet. Longflight freebooze<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anybody in my network interested in a director level 911 type job in the Middle East? Get to live the expat life. DM me. emcomm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get my favorite usher and have people move for that crap. Preferably out of the building . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So why the great hate between those two?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still have to take the trip. I just have to stay elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well poo. I don't get to stay in a Marriott for my trip to Frederick, MD because none of their 4 hotels there have govt rates avail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah, I love my attorneys. Took one on a mutual aid deployment once. Saved the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give me lawyers over !#%* measles any day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today: meetings, lawyers, auditors, cancelled meetings, late meetings, leaky hillsides, measles. Just another day in the EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's in my job title. Based on that, it's possibly my only mission!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest problem with Hootsuite is inability to share accounts. Can't use for work as account is attached to diff login.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been pretty quiet. smemchat distracted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found it and retweeted it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw it scroll through on the hashtag. From FEMA Region 7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't have it handy, but it's in the IAEMETC stream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was the IAEMETC webinar. Posted in that hashtag as well. smemchat yikyak instagram<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: no. Earthquake prep requires non-structural mitigating also. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: something to consolidate all the damage reporting apps. Many out there, as EM, can't access them all. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you see my stuff on geo based Instagram searches and Yik Yak for desktop? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We post in English per org policy. It's the only language we can guarantee 24/7. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Between now and the middle of March I'll be going to Maryland twice, Chicago, Fairbanks, and both Vancouvers. Oh, and Ocean Shores. EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My musings on measles, vaccinations, and terrorism. Yes, they're related.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fav sb49 commercials: The Chevy one. Nearly caused a riot in the house! And likeagirl because it was awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well bugger. Interestingly, we did a test last year of paid advertising for a conf. MUCH better ROI on LinkedIn than Facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always fun to discover that an app you explicitly told NOT to tweet did so anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This city has lost its mind! sb49 seattle seahawks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's a large sized superb_owl, just in time to cheer on the seahawks! 3DPrint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My quest to print a new, larger superb_owl was thwarted by having to print a "make it better" piece for the 3dprinter. Trying again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you were wondering, wunderground has some of the best customer support anywhere. My odd request was handled same day! winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For SMEM folks near Chicago, DisasterCTR is bringing the NDPTC PER304 course to you. It's free!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. 40MB download required to join NDPTC webinar. gonnabelate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How I spent my day off: smemchat contributor, STTechTalk lurker, NDPTC webinar. And a 90 minute massage. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The DIRECTV installers are here. Young one CONVINCED he knows my hubby somehow. Keep hearing random questions like "were you a teacher"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto. And more coffee drinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now to rearrange my TweetDeck columns for sttechtalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. My phone just made the special duty officer alert sound, but there's no message there. iphonemysteries. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, blocking is generally only done by consensus of team, with exceptions for hate speech. instaban. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|><--- former piepc board member. Current committee member. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a big fan of blocking them on Facebook. They can still access info, but they can't contribute nastiness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. I miss being able to do homework at work. Ah graveyard shift, how I miss you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tell my volunteers to ignore trolls though and escalate those issues to staff. Gotta watch out for my vols! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ignore the trolls! Ok, I know we can't always, but still, I want to. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would love to send you a DM ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree x100! Active monitoring is a completely different skill set than type and send. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know! Been in comms with some people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we might be planning that for IAEMETC too conf call or webinar too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but TeamRubicon is a little slow to process applications! askmehowIknow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just posted an open invite to play with vost. Now's your chance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I'm talking to electds or admins, I start with why. If talking to staff or vols who already know why, we go to how and what. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damnit TweetDeck. Where did you put that post I was writing?? scroll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>VOSTs both push and pull info. Talk to sct_r about them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(psst. We just call him Craig). cc: CraigatFEMA smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, exactly my point! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I was looking from bringing a new organization on-board. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cali's been saying that since November!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find it funny that we approach it from completely opposite viewpoints! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A3: depends on audience. Eventually, everybody needs Why, then How, then What. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, good morning! Nice to see you on smemchat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Red Cross also has digi volunteers. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to joint a VOST team. sct_r can help you with that. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: I'm going to go with no for purely self-serving reasons. I'm going to watch the game, not be on social media! :P smemchat GoHawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's good to have catch-up time sometimes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We also have a weather station on the EOC roof for hyperlocal weather reports. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have a very tech savvy crowd in the Bay Area, so many probably have geotags shut off. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you get any sleep last night??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use NWS and get spot forecasts direct from them as needed. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: I really didn't seem them, being on the opposite coast. I am curious about how effective they were though. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think jasonlindy is going to throw out the first smemchat question today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 36 degrees and foggy here. I know this because my weather station is finally working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sounds like something that would make me spork my eyeballs out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will you be here for smemchat today? Those are some good topics you threw down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been up for 15 minutes. :P dayoff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No idea. Just sat down. Haven't finished first cup of coffee yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's almost time for smemchat. If you're interested in the use of social media in emergency management, this is the place to be at 0930 PST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For King County (WA) area first responders, radiomatters would be a good follow. Working on the new radio replacement project.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this to top off my day. In the work garage. Tgif<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Behold! I have printed superb_owl! Though i believe he is a seahawk at heart. GoHawks sb49<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are awesome! Go take a listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appears we're taking Foundations TTT together. Along w/ 4 of my Leader Academy classmates, so I'll apologize for that in advance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It looks like I'm finally going to meet doyle0213 in person. Woot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, the Washington Service Corps is on Twitter now! Follow them at wscbuzz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Introduced my 12 year old nephew to it at defcon last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was a specific request to have Jawbone speak on their Napa quake data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tired of godaddy? Try out asmallorange. I don't get anything for promoting them, I just like them! godaddy nodaddy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bummer. Jawbone turned down my request for eugmandel or someone from their data team to talk to IAEMETC about wearables/data/disasters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aw, Facebook is up before we could get the BBS back up and connected to IRC. Maybenexttime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But do you have a phone to connect to it with??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IRC, the original home of . Oldschool notdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I turned to Twitter in lieu of TV. Best entertainment of the year this far. itsalldown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When all else fails, revert to irc. If you don't know what that means, it probably means I'm old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cat is a horrible editor! But provides good moral support. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Helper cat is helping me post grades tonight. PST314. Lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So by my current count, 3 Puget Sound area shootings tonight. One day of warm weather and people lose their minds!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. First tweet from news media about Southcenter mall shooting was 15 minutes after first tweet from inside the mall. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Contribute to hashtags on subjects you're knowledgeable about. Pretty much a sure fired way to get more followers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking that would be useful for getting spiders ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody know of someplace local to Seattle where I could get old Seattle Filmworks film developed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crawling around on the garage roof did not result in the weather station working better. It did result in some tree trimming though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had lunch on the back patio, listened to birds, watched eagle and squirrels. It's a beautiful spring day! Except it's still winter. WAWX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drinking a Salted Belgian Chocolate Stout (Lips of Faith) by newbelgium/PerennialBeer -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's inefficient to make me to call in the 1st place, then to have to hold, give my info, get transferred, hold, give my info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently the new weather station base station has an alarm. And somehow I set it to midnight. It's really loud. scaredme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the big leagues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the usher and the cop seemed to make an impression . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know how I can tell it's the weekend? The EAS goes off in the middle of the night. So much for that good night's sleep! Emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dumb to throw your beverage against the opposing team's occupied penalty box. Especially on camera. Bet she won't do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget the ones still stuck in the netting! Teddybeartoss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goal! letsgobirds tbirds teddybeartoss @ Seattle Thunderbirds Hockey Game @ The Showare Center<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's teddy bear toss night! Hopefully we score. Turns into teddy bear riot if we don't! letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out we still have one in the basement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things found while cleaning today: Original copy of Windows 2000. Two "pictures on disk" on 3 1/2" floppies. No 3 1/2 drive in this house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a very aboveboard manner, so as not to be accused of cheating!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outdoor temp/barometer not reporting to base. Looks like a trip to the garage roof is in order. Bugger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After all these years, I finally got summoned for jury duty. And I can go! Yay!! Truly, I'm excited. I view this as my patriotic duty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For NDPTC. Social Media for Natural Disaster Response and Recovery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I generally choose my teaching assignments based on whether I can get there direct on AlaskaAir . spoiled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rewards are better when you're a brand loyalist! I'm Avis Preferred, AlaskaAir Gold and Marriott Silver. happy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My husband was top tear Hilton when he travelled a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're Wyndham timeshare owners. Was trying to swap into a Worldmark. Wasn't available. I'm Marriott Silver, so staying there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the best way for a company to lose my business is to make me hold, then make me hold some more. Take note clubwyndham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much to my delight, when I got the new OregonScientifi base station plugged in, all the roof sensors save one were still reporting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My husband should not be allowed to go to harborfreight without me. I want new toys too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, check your e-mail. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! That's what I just said!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's that like?? :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do. I use an automated program to post alerts to Facebook. We get a lot of feedback about the all caps format tho smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, can you follow or send an e-mail so I can dm with you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes somebody makes an archive. smemchat They'll post it under the tag after we're done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should say "admit" not "admin". derp smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First they have to be willing to listen, then to accept help. The to admin they don't know everything. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use hootsuite on my mobile device, tweetdeck on my computer. Integrated into Chrome. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which county are we talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You probably won't if it's a one person shop. No bandwidth. Need to get vols to do for them. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TweetDeck is all I use at home. I forget it has a web interface sometimes. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switching to TweetDeck. Please standby ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. I hate the Twitter native client, especially in IE. Gonna tear my hair out in smemchat today!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have not. They don't lead much. Those counties can ask for the PER304 in their jurisdiction tho. it's free. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not directly. It does after you place a call. We dump all our E911 data in it, so we know landlines are all there. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of resources. PER 304 (online or live) and IS-42 are good places to start. smemchat basics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not assigned yet. Name will go up on the site as soon as it is. smemchat ndptc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We use ours for non-emergency events. We test all staff/volunteers annually. We don't do city-wide due to $$ and legal. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We use CodeRed and have for many years. We're pretty happy with it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A goal is important. Getting shut out leads to a teddy bear riot! ugly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the spam. You're now blocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Me too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew there must be some creature in the world that likes that stuff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Note to self: make sure the risk manager and the attorney are the people writing contracts. Don't consider contracts written by Finance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will be fun! My first plane ride was to Chicago when I was 14. Got to visit the PD dispatch center!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have nausea just reading that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realized that I've already met the requirements for my iaem CEM recert. Not due until 2018!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nfl sure issues a lot of fines for a non-profit trade association. I guess they need that money to promote their obscure product.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or the opposite. When you discover an actor who plays a jerk (but plays it well) is an actual jerk in real life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which finish?? Cherry or walnut baby grand is on my bucket list. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What did you get??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Overachiever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine keeps subbing STFU. Also legit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it was on the iaem calendar of events. It was advertised via the region email lists, at least in Regions 9 & 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully Hawaii.. . . BOOT principal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the kind words friends! It turns out I talk a lot less in the webinar format. :P smem iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh great. Now the expectation is set at awesome! nopressure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready for the iaemetc social media webinar. If you're an iaem member, you still have about 45 minutes to register! smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I was missed over the long weekend. EMlife @ City of Auburn Emergency Management<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn the fine print!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might just be dense, but when I went to the FanHeatMap website, there's nothing there that seems usable. What am I missing??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ingress tips from the waiter and a view of food magic. @ Joule Restaurant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My computer now thinks it's an Android device. Well, part of it does anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That doesn't sound good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And saying "I told you so" generally doesn't play well either. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those are so cool! We have a big one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind did you get?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No kidding! I have a pic in my files from many years ago on a SAR mission. We found one blocking our way. Photo is trying move it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cleaning the basement tonight and found a box of 1991/92 French Pro Set NHL hockey cards. WhereDidThoseComeFrom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They weren't real fans if they left early!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now back to hauling cinder blocks up the basement stairs, as we dismantle the shelves built by previous owners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweet, a little bitter, but coffee bitter. Tasty. - Drinking a Split Shot by ElysianBrewing -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ack! We just blew the circuit for our entertainment center in the middle of the Seahawks game. Reset, but DirecTV takes forever to reboot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does the weather get crazy whenever I have a long weekend? Phone beeping, EAS honking, me not sleeping. EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weny to attach weather station monitor to computer in my office. Batteries exploded and it won't power up on AC. Time for a new one ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Green. We're green. Aka: Enlightened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's cuz you're one of the cool kids!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sent. It's sort of a cross between capture the flag and geocaching. And the cool kids join the enlightened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who wants Ingress invites? It's a game. In the real world. That's all you need to know. :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Life was easier when my parents were trying to embrace technology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annnnd, apparently SMEMchat dies out with a wimper today. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've worked in Admin/Mayor, Public Works, and Police. Never fire. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are in the US too, but they serve different functions. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, fire and EM are really not that engrained. Fire is first response. EM isn't. SMEMchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It will be. One project at a time! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Copchat happens once a week or so. lesm smemchat smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sort of working on that very thing for IAEMETC SMEMchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is that govs are either poor or cheap. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, it can't hurt to ask! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that it can pull twitter, instagram, maybe others and plot on same map. Have found plenty that will do just one. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about a paid one that's easy to use and web based? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, but I want something that is multi platform. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone found a free service that will search twitter/instagram/etc for geotagged posts and plot them to a map? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah. schuback I don't think we've ever been here simultaneously! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No texting and driving man! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm actually here for SMEMCHAT today. Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm suspicious of this website that tells me my best chance of success is to use IE 8. That's three versions ago. And it's IE. derp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Heh. Got a follow from PelicanProducts today. Apparently they know what's stored in the dark places of the EOC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We rent a Class A RV every year for Labor Day weekend from elmonterv. No more Seattle location though. sadday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What were you back there for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw the funniest hashtag ever. But it's wildly inappropriate and thus I can't use it. I'm supposed to be professional or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Webinar on CascadiaRising earthquake exercise scenario underway. Science is cool. And scary.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Officially super impressed with OtterBox. Broke my case on Friday, new one is already on it's way under warranty replacment. awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't really explain this. Lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was totally worth postponing the hockey game for. :P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's awesome! Thanks for reaching out. I'll get right on that. Well, after morning coffee ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think there's a typo in that chart. Name spelled wrong . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This feels an awful lot like a Monday, except I got to wear my Seahawks jersey to work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, you make it easy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. Gifts from AlaskaAir! That's the best email I've gotten all week. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Making me wait 15 minutes in line, making my coffee, THEN telling me you're only taking cash today was not cool BigFootJava. GetItTogether<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Possibly my fav thing from the CES pile of awesome. Useful for SMEM, IAEMETC and everybody else in disaster relief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much awesome at CES, some useful for IAEMETC (mini drone). Some just cool (pet cube!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I refuse to call them every time I have to reset my password. IT left of copy of Chrome in the EOC tho, so did it myself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to try to reset my HSIN account. Again. Wish me luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think one of my co-workers has one actually. I have to settle for my fingerless gloves and an extra fleece for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keeping my office door closed for this very long conference call. It's so cold in here now! brrrrrr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pro tips for conference calls: 1) mute your phone; 2) don't put the call on hold. This is going to be a long three hours . . . EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I'm glued to a chair and in charge of budgets, but I still think it's funny! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want the subtitle of my social media situational awareness presentation to be "WTF is going on out there", but some may be offended<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to be doing a webinar on the 20th for IAEMETC. If that goes well, I might write about it! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Favorite tools for real time SMEM data mining, any/all platforms? 1,2,3 go . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joined in the sense of "also did", not joint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're separate entities, so they have to declare emergencies independently. They can't declare for each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's horrible!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to river rescue on the scanner. Can't fathom why somebody thought rafting & kayaking in Western Washington was a good idea today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Filled out a TeamRubicon application last night, as a "kick-ass civilian". That amused me. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love all the descriptors we have for rain in the PNW. Right now, my phone says "light drizzle mist". It sounds gloomy yet refreshing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. ancestry writes horrible software. And their solution is to shrug and tell you to start over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for semi-annual delink/redownload/relink/merge process for Family Tree Maker. Thanks ancestry for sucking the joy out of this hobby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear ancestry has to have the worst software ever written. Forced update blew up my data file. Now instead of fun, must go to the backup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not really looking forward to returning to the real world tomorrow ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, I'm sticking with corn that pretends to be sugar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What material did he have on his hand?? Never heard that before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. I think your system is broken. I've directed it resend my confirmation 4 times, to two diff addresses. NoLuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MIldly annoying. Used Budget for a rental for the first time. Confirmation never arrived in e-mail, and only way to get is to call them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Helper cat is helping. At least he's out of the chair! Lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moved the old chair to my office. Stood up for 2 seconds. Where am I supposed to sit? Lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, they're having issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See the post I just retweeted ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried it from wifi and from data? Just running through the usual troubleshooting ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you login from your device using the mobile site rather than the app?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reboot the device? Check for interfering spam blocker or similar?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't remember your password or it's not working?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, they do. Have for years. PETA is on that list too. They both use violence to encourage social or political change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alaska: the only place where packing to the bathroom is actually a necessity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was happy there was running water and no bears or mama moose camped out by the privy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Alaska! Find me a cabin with heat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except me: "Welcome Home!" I think it was the long braid and the plaid. Or they just knew I love it there. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funniest AlaskaAir story I have: went to AK with girlfriends for conf. Got off plane, all greeted with "Welcome to AK" .... 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! Lived here my whole life! There's no place like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had another 13K miles this year that didn't even count toward status!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it is! Which is why I'm MVP Gold now! Hubby is Gold for life on AmericanAir, from the more leg room days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a good article! Between my husband and I, one of us has maintained elite status for ~15 years. WeMissAllTheFun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone has at this point. smem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yay!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now to go more places!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No kidding! (She says from 30k feet over Wyoming)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And sometime about now, I hit AlaskaAir MVP Gold, in the skies above Wyoming. IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course! 6 hour haul from Tampa to Seattle. I think it has to be just about the longest flight they offer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're missing our first game all season, but we'll be following along on Twitter from 30k feet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude next to me on the plane is chewing and spitting in a Perrier bottle. Gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are! Great combo of sound quality and features.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long plane rides just got a lot more pleasant thanks to the parrot Zik headphones the hubs got me for Christmas. These things are awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, not me. I'm at TPA now, getting ready to come home on AlaskaAir. LongFlight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no, that was just the overhead page for in-house maintenance to respond to a bathroom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What delay??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I know that a "Code 10" at TPA is a clogged toilet. ThingsYouLearnInAirports<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've had three cards on this account this year for same reason! No actual fraud though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. I travel with it all the time tho and never have issues. Their canned "unusual activity" response was BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annoying to have to be more accountable to bankofamerica than to my family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Irony: spent $$$ on Amazon. No problem. Rent my car and get some food on vacation and bankofamerica shuts my card down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Day 2 of teaching CERT TTT and I think I'm getting a cold.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Loading wheelchairs on SoundTransit bus seems overly long and complicated. Late 578 now even later.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. that's better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, you know better than to use candles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Auburn, dry, calm, yes. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we're all cheering on the new wind gage, just to see what it looks like when it bumps up to the next scale on the graphic. EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, however there are those who do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I generally make EOC coffee that's far too strong, on the theory that people can water it down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bought in bulk. Made in machines that are never cleaned. Drank by people who are desperate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They deliver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not here. We have flood control dams that do a very good job. No major floods here since the 50s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fairly calm so far. Peak gust we've seen downtown Auburn is 23 MPH. Probably higher on the hills though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, and there will be a fee for the license.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EOC messes with my head. 4 TVs, only 1 at a time with audio. Always looking up trying to find the screen that matches the audio! EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, yeah, not using that on the pro account!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm fond of hellastorm personally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But that other one is sooooo long. PNWWind could have been good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm afraid we didn't order enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're eating EOC pizza, working on configuring our new weather station, and watching traffic cams shake in the wind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That first one is too long!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And coffee. We learned our lesson in the last storm. No generator for the break room. We got our own coffee pot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That does not sound like fun! We're eating pizza in the EOC. The wind is just arriving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! That one's even older than mine was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well crap. Old kitty has a tumor. Not fixable, at least not at 18 1/2 years old. Gonna make him comfy for a little while longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weather station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was probably not the best day to install the station on the EOC roof, yet we are. EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a "when worlds collide" tweet. I know all three of you for totally diff reasons. SmallWorld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe just retweet next time. Saves confusion. Especially in the middle of an event where we're actively monitoring new info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, which is why it's confusing to announce in the middle of the megastorm with no link and no clarification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is he even relevant anymore?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should clarify that it has nothing to do with current storm. Timing makes it confusing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tracking the sarcastic is good too. Gives you and idea of the mood. And sometimes useful stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So weird to see the entire West Coast tweeting about the same storm. It's going to be a long 36 hours for SMEM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But you did one day and it was hilarious! Tracy IS the traffic. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would buy stock in this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or if you're really brave, just a geolocated Twitter search of all tweets in the general vicinity. Usually NSFW though! SMEM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks. We're a little bit inland, but we're still going to get whalloped!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty much anybody who uses the hashtag is a safe bet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annnnd there goes the cortisone burnoff. Gotta love heart palpitations. I should probably not drink anymore coffee today though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could totally see you loving 1.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pssssst, AlaskaAir, thanks for the upgrade! IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, because I forgot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I reported it this morning when I saw it on my phone. Even on the tiny screen it was a pretty obvious fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And sadly, when reported to Facebook for being an altered image, they say it meets their standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess my great love of Christmas music is no longer a mystery though!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Strange day for wawx. Tornado warnings, winter storm warnings, hydro outlooks of doom. Might be a long week ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we move on to the skills competition portion of the game. IHateShootouts hockey tbirds silvertips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. 19 year old kid from Russia. Never want to see a player go down like that. Hockey tbirds silvertips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it's not. Probably way worse for their family who are probably watching or listening from afar. Hockey tbirds silvertips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ambulance just pulled up to side door. Full c-spine precautions on the player as they wheel him off the ice. Hockey tbirds silvertips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now what appears to be a doctor on the ice. Not good. Hockey tbirds silvertips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Never good when they bring the stretcher out on the ice. Hockey tbirds silvertips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hockey night! LetsGoBirds (@ Seattle Thunderbirds in Kent, WA)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great article by FrankCatalano on scientific literacy. Fits recent IAEMETC discussions about baseline knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want to be an SMEM intern? HumanityRoad is looking for some!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, time for food and e-mail catch up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use my HAM team for social media monitoring. As they pointed out, "it's just message traffic". :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well kids, it's 1030 PST, meaning smemchat is officially over for today. Have a great weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can also take it at EMI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, working on ideas now. iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good news is that an entire issue of the iaem Bulletin is probably going to be about SMEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, but the new TTT course, teaches you how to teach, not how to be the SME.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's still an objective or goal, not a task. Tasks are "go put out that fire" or "go monitor twitter".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were a few that touched on it in various ways. But nothing dedicated I don't think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new TTT is fantastic, so I recommend taking it. But may or may not be required by your agency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. Depends on sponsoring agency requirements. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're from within driving distance of Portland. You're a hipster by default. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a new course, but CERT isn't a certification. It's a certificate of completion, so no, doesn't expire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those are not tasks. Those are goals and/or objectives. Tasks happen at the tactical level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I say huge value. Great networking, great info. Many go on own dime. I have. smemchat iaem14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CERT doesn't get to define tasks. We define tasks for our CERT members. And they're not SMEM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stay hydrated! smemchat iaemetc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed! I can teach somebody to tweet, but if I don't teach them why, they may not be able to adapt to, say, YikYak. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Practice without theory = failure If you don't know the why, you can't adapt to the changes. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That really doesn't have anything to do with the theory of SMEM though. That's about use, not technique. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wahahaha! insidejoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I posted that last night! Pay attention. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what intelligence gathering is at any level, whether international or hyperlocal. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comment I heard was "tasked to a student worker". smemchat yikyak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is on many campuses. And it's a huge PITA, but necessary. smemchat yikyak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My question about basics is a loaded one. Trying to set a baseline to use for IAEMETC that goes beyond "this is how we tweet". smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite true, but it's a systemic problem that doesn't just impact DHS. It's the heart of social equity as well. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just described all of corporate America (as well as government). smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yik Yak is extremely huge on college campuses. Every college campus EM I've talked to knows about it. smemchatIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To clarify UN hashtag question, it wasn't about the tags, it was about what we though about the UN trying to provide guidance. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More accurately, it lost funding inside DHS. But agree that it should be local anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does "simple stuff" look like to you? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's try this: How do we get ppl to accept that SMEM is a moving target and technique is more important than platform? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody (you know who you are) suggested we may need a bank of IVs for "Clark County" next year. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll throw this out then: how about the UN hashtag proposal. Thoughts? smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus some detox is possibly in order too. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No kidding! Me too. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So smemchat is looking a little dead today! Is there anybody here??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, no, that's "Another world, another time". Lyrics from my fav crystalmethod song!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In another tab. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should be here for SMEMCHAT today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops. I just realized that in the pandemonium that was IAEM14, I forgot to grade my PST314 student's homework on Monday. MyBad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being in Texas for the last week, I sort of forgot how dark it is at home. Sunrise after I get up, sunset while I'm still at work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Home! Well, same state anyway. (@ Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) in Seatac, WA)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So IAEMETC members (and groupies), what cool new stuff do you want to learn about this coming year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love to fly at night. Cities look so cool from 30,000 feet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the plus side, we've been blessed with an exceptionally funny crew! IFlyAlaska<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. They weren't using the display board either, so there was no visual reference to check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad show AlaskaAir. Poor line management and PA at SAT. MVPs never heard their call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SAT to SEA. Homeward bound at last! See you all next year iaem. IAEM14 IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annnnnd, suzannefrew is now teaching with the hiccups! NDPTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complete with laser beam eyes . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EM is such a small world. Only 3 people in this class I don't have a connection to already. EMLife NDPTC IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Food worthy of praise and song! GoodEats @ Ruth's Chris Steak House San Antonio - River Walk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We increased our followers by about 1/3 during last week's power outage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like my AlaskaAir flight from SAT to SEA is packed. GetCozy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is pouring buckets outside right now. SanAntonio rain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One last day of brain cramming. Leveraging Tools for Coordinated Community Disaster Communications class. NDPTC IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I forgot to call home for 4 days. MyBad EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure that was one of the silent auction items. Iaem can probably figure out who won it. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love watching my friends, colleagues, and former students get their CEM and AEM awards. IAEM14 WelcomeToTheClub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know you took pictures at karaoke. Where are they??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because getting in an alphabetical line is hard! AmIRight iaem14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for sponsoring the Crisis Tech Center! iaem14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's nap time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little R & R before heading to the closing banquet. One last visit with friends, old and new. iaem14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you have to bring in the outside expert in order to be taken seriously, even when you are an equal expert. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big shout out given to SeattlePD at IAEM14 for creative messaging campaigns. It involved Doritos. SayNoMore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great examples of innovation being shared in the room. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embrace next generation Emergency Managers, mentor them, encourage their creativity. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't continue doing the same things and expecting different outcomes. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Invite-a-Friend is great example of filling gaps, increasing diversity, creating pathways to innovation. IAEM14 iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take an inventory of skills and knowledge and work to fill the gaps. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to recognize your own privilege and bias in order to truly foster creativity. Recognize and embrace differences. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes need a mediator or bridge between less creative and more creative thinking people. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Creative ideas challenge our assumptions, status quo, authority, and us personally. Seek people who are different from you. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fostering innovation requires judgement free brainstorming. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to be comfortable with some level of chaos in order to foster innovation. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Innovation requires more than having an open door. Requires taking calculated risks, question status quo. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To foster innovation, create safe spaces and be aware of limiting behaviors. Keep minds open and avoid "we don't do that here". IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the idea comes from students, college administrators have a hard time ignoring it. Students should be your allies! iaem14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Universities are using their mascots to promote preparedness. It garners immediate attention from students. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't let your idea of professionalism keep you from reaching target audience. Capitalize on what's popular and relevant to them. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your message can be enhanced by capitalizing on popular culture. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Photos and videos can help get your preparedness message across. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Memes are images that convey ideas. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do we create safe spaces that allow for innovation? IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fostering innovation presentation by Alisha_Beth and ElizabethKingEM IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the San Antonio I remember! Sun warm IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish I could be in two places at once so I could hear find_doc speak! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep getting blank "Breaking News" emails from CNN today. Annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Risk=something bad might happen. Crisis=something bad has happened. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Risk perception is subjective. Based on personal bias. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Risk communication and crisis communication are not the same thing. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Science and technology is a two way conversation. Reporting is one way. Hinders understanding. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>28% of people don't know the earth revolves around the sun. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People generally like scientists and trust what they have to say. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most people get their idea of science and scientists from pop culture. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blinded by Science in 103A. IAEM14. How to make the complicated understandable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1770 people registered for IAEM14 this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's better. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Invite-a-Friend brought 4149 new members to iaem, invited by 723 existing members. Awesome IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who says meetings are boring? Bruce_Lock is briefing us about Legos! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, you need to stop by the Crisis Tech Center! They can take your photo so you can quit "being the egg". IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more contribution to the scholarship fund got me this! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Memorial service is always sad. The list is always too long. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're gathered for the iaem USA Council meeting. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crisis Tech Booth. IAEM14 IAEMETC noahreiter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At IAEM14 Crisis Tech Booth now: noahreiter talking about emergency notification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did! Thanks for the invite. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, having a good time. Maybe you'll make it next year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Karaoke night! (@ The Republic of Texas - _republicoftx in San Antonio, TX)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Do you have a medevac?" "Yep, we have a pickup." IAEM14 OHinEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, to be fair, it has nothing to do with the conference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like it's dinner and karaoke tonite! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Giving the live auction a go. I really want the iaem wine glasses! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Learn how to run your EOC on Chromebooks and ChromeCast! MarcBurdiss presenting in the Crisis Tech Center. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss my SAR days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be great if every committee and caucus got to have 5 minutes to tell the general session what they're working on. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is this sign-in you speak of?? IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, it's my job to fix that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First dibs on data? PickMe PickMe Not hard, since no other hands went up! IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a great chat with HELPresponse at IAEM14 today. Great people doing great things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Secret's out. I'm a nerd. IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anybody from IAEMETC accidentally picked up a bag that wasn't yours from the booth, can you give a shout?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big thanks to ravemsafety and itdrc for sponsoring the IAEM14 Crisis Technology Center. IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool demos coming up at the Crisis Technology Center. Don't miss them! Booth 129, IAEM14 IAEMEtc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody in your EOC needs to be assigned to critical thinking, separate from everything else that's going on. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An EOC is critical to successful transition to recovery. "Wheels come off the bus" if transition not well managed. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not one person is immune to human emotion, regardless of training and experience. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Staff require time to heal after large incidents. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adaptive leadership is critical to successful response. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Relationships and partnerships are critical. Only reason Snohomish County accomplished their mission. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plans are designed to fail. Frameworks are flexible and can bend to the situation. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landslide was a crystal ball of what growth, climate change, and related issues may look like. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pennington: largest disaster I ever faced was the smallest I ever saw. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Large turnout for Pennington's SR530 response presentation. Still a few seats open though. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear people, Please refrain from having phone conversations while using the restroom, Sincerely, Everyone. IAEM14 BadBehavior<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On my way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The spillover: people who are helped after disaster often go on to help others on the next disaster. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to have to break out my hat and gloves in this ballroom! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sympathetic listening and identification are critical traits of volunteers. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's why I asked! It's also military support in some places and LE in others. Doesn't exist at all in Washington State!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw, what is ESF16 where you are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I grew up in rural America, where all responders were volunteers, so yes, probably different existence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I disagree. Local communities utilized volunteers for emergency response since the founding of this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just for the record, Brenda Phillips was one of my favorite grad school professors at jsunews jaxstate IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Volunteers were critical far before we came up with CERT and Citizen Corps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish my phone wouldn't randomly turn photos 90 degrees . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Volunteers provide the services that government cannot after disaster. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Volunteers are less bureaucratic and more flexible. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Volunteers can catch those who fall through the cracks and provide access to established networks. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Volunteers: first to arrive, last to leave. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people volunteer? Altruism, civic duty, faith, benefits. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The air conditioning in the main room is on overdrive. Brrrrrrr! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next up: Brenda Phillips, to address volunteering as community building. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pennington: localized catastrophic incidents create a new normal. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pennington: small incidents can be catastrophic. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time I've ever seen a national presentation on an incident I responded to. IAEM14 SR530Slide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, the hashtag is IAEM14 :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for being here! And for supporting the CEM! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's only about 3 feet deep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The EM Think Tank will continue under the banner of iaem. Awesome IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advice for the day: if you fall in the river in San Antonio, stand up. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Conference app is a huge battery hog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good dinner with good friends. Now to sleep. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>35 people for Region 10 meeting. Good show! iaem14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still an alarming number of people in our field who don't use social media though. Gotta learn somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF is wrong with people? That's horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like the purple better, but this will do. IAEM14 @ Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cloudy with a chance of big data. Should be interesting! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're doing international relief work, make sure your passport is good for at least 6 months. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure I hear somebody snoring . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1000 criminals were released from jail so they wouldn't drown, but caused great concern and some extra crime during Haiyan. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be afraid to let your story be told. Enjoy some good PR. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pre-plan your partnerships whenever possible. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Logistics, flexibility, local partnerships, sensitivity were critical to Haiyan response. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typhoon Haiyan: 160+ mph winds. 4 million people displaced. 6000 dead. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to hear about Typhoon Haiyan Medical Response at IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well there's that too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those were my idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yeah. Just dehydrated. Found that the coffee stand sells Gatorade too, so I'll grab after lunch. Just trying to avoid illness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to find some Gatorade in the vicinity of iaem14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it's not Friday, but my EM, SMEM, EMLife, IAEM14 friends should go follow Minmatt45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can have my cat follow you if that would make you feel better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whew! Not just me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This room is making me feel blind. I'm sure it's the projectors and not my eyes. Right? IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you're wondering, the PowerPoints for the sessions are in the app. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we serve anybody who happens to be there, even if they're not community members.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still partial to people. Keep it human and simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Space weather is something we don't think about much." Unless you're a hamradio operator. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that our field continuously refers to the people we help as "citizens". We help people. Period. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of our Nigerian friends asking what US can do to help them prepare for disaster in Africa. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fixed mine with a sharpie. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's just for starters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody just schooled the room on the Cascadia earthquake threat. There was applause. ThankYou IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exciting things can happen when you scan your badge QR code. Unintended things. IAEM14 IAEMEtc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will find you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't be bored this week! IAEM14 @ Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Start with the Google search I sent you. Had lots of info that would be useful to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't have an answer for that, but if you inform a few volunteers, they can tell others for free!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I searched Google for " landslide risk reduction uganda" and saw lots of information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Favorite new word from yesterday: "silofication". IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do a Google search for "disaster preparedness" and that name of your country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a member, I don't represent the organization in those questions. Contact your local chapter to find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IAEM is an organization with Councils around the world. There are meetings in local areas. Not an internet thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the International Association of Emergency Management. Disaster managers from around the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have a techspert ribbon for me??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than 4000 new members joined iaem through Invite-a-Friend. Welcome! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the hot water outage at the Hyatt, sounds like we might have to set up a shower brigade. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A worse issue would be no coffee!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonus: there was no line at the overpriced coffee stand this morning. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with our first Semper Gumbie of the week (it involved flags), IAEM14 is underway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And overslept. Alarm was set for next Saturday. Oops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. So tired. So much to learn. So many new friends to make. Brain full. Feet hurt. Body weary. Must sleep. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to loan my hat and gloves to my Hawaiian friend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I were not dead tired, I would join you. I live for karaoke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personal phone dead! Something sucking battery. Walk back to my room will be a good cigar smoking opportunity. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to head over to the Buckhorn and be the ambassador I'm supposed to be. IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure you rocked it! IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never had a priest take one of my classes before. thatsnew cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We get a 90 minute lunch break for emergency HVAC work. Woohoo? IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you here too??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ibuprofen found! New backpack has too many pockets. I forgot about that one . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now was not the time to discover my bottle of ibuprofen is missing from my backpack!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last day of SA & COP training underway. Somebody brought me a gift! YouPass IAEM14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting our learn on at SA & COP training. IAEM14 @ Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teaching all day, then gathering in the evening. You coming? It's on the iaemetc calendar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since yesterday!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Meal of EOC champions everywhere: pizza and coffee. Bonus: both warm! EMLife<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We've been getting comms from NWS about this for 2 days though. Regular blowing up of the e-mail. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had an advisory here I thought, but don't see it now. We just had a 40 MPH gust at Auburn Airport though, advisory or no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently. And several warnings for nearby areas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good news is that if I get called in to work, the coffee maker there is on generator .... wawx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today we've got everybody using TweetDeck and learning how to use good search terms + filter out retweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My volunteers just confirmed for me that our original training did not have an outline. Or handouts! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn't an actual training. It's an EOC activation for an event. I will have to see if I have my original trng outline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using today to retrain SMEM volunteers in the EOC. Their skills have gotten a little rusty!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Planning, PIO, and Comms in a nice little grouping. Easy to talk to each other. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think bottom line is that you put SM where it works for YOU, not for somebody else. We all have different needs. SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have SM team that interfaces with PIO and Planning. They're part of our Communications Team. Have own area of EOC. SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, but it has to be a team, not just a PIO. A PIO gets too much thrown at them to do it all. SMEMCHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SR530 Landslide is good case study. So is Skagit bridge collapse. MDeyerin has good info. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SM monitor can't direct actions, only give info. IC still makes decisions. Use case studies, exercises to make point. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We monitor SM remotely and pass relevant info to Incident Command. Safer, easier, trusted. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And I might have just eaten half a jar of homemade (not by me) spicy dill pickles .#yummers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's all in the approach!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but referring to them or calling them old timers is a good way to alienate them and make sure they never change! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not just "old timers" though. Plenty of new people have little tech experience or knowledge. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on their background and experience. I find some existing concept to relate it to that's relevant to them. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pulling in right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice panel lineup for that event too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're all Seattle nerds. Maybe we can meet up IRL and discuss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That explains the "don't turn your back on that toilet" comment I heard earlier . . . defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Almost did several years ago. Doing one on diversity at another con with Alisha_beth. We can overhaul for defcon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that gives me an idea for a talk to put in for next year. Defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI, using your tablet as a phone makes you look silly. Getaheadset defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Giving a couple hundred kids Chromebooks = awesome. Doing it in a room with no power outlets = sadness. r00tzasylum defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning from Vegas smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amused by the number of people who come to defcon with the intent of sitting and listening to talks. Far more interesting things to do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because everybody needs to solder in the morning. r00tzasylum Defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nephew skipped the 2 and 1 for this. He thinks it's worth it! Defcon r00tzasylum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've always had luck seeing the ones I really wanted to. Maybe you will too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminiscing in the r00tzasylum line. We remember defcon 4 nametags. The stick on kind, that you used a sharpie to put a name on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's why they're almost all recorded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Officially in line for r00tzasylum. Lineconjr defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always pick up new followers at cons. Most probably end up thinking WTF shortly after that con ends. DiverseInterests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. TommydCat hard at work. badgehack defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, you are here this year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not listed i don't think. DM me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a 206 gathering Friday night defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>13. His first defcon. Mind blown!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nephew: ... The little round thing on the lanyard. Me: that's a rotary phone dial. Nephew: a what? Defcon old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>30 minutes on the floor of the Chill Out Lounge and nephew has picked all my practice locks. Defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just mentioned that we've been coming to defcon since 4. The incredulous look from the kid in front of me was not born yet I think. Old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. Migraine. Not the way I wanted to start this year's defcon adventure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got personalized defcon schwag. It's awesome! Hamradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello Vegas! Defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SEA - LAS defcon bound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any way to upgrade somebody from 6A to first on 616 tonight using miles? Nephew ended up behind me . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Headed out to visit the neighborhoods! NNO NNOAuburn EMLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My 1 apparently just became r00tzasylum registration because 13 yr old + chromebook hallway campout fml defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband texted me to say he just saw a VERY OLD photo of himself on the screen at BSidesLV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This mandatory training involves the facilitator reading to us from a packet we were already required to read. StillBored<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. So bored. And so cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that AmeriCorps makes members choose between involvement in democratic process and claiming their affiliation online. SeemsWrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All day AmeriCorps supervisor training. With a migraine. Then NNOAuburn 'til 2100. LongDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MT WeatherNation: there's something you don't see every day... A tornado was spotted just outside Las Vegas last night. GoFigure defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. It's way to warm to sleep tonight. May have to retreat to basement. SleeplessInSeattle hot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that made my day. Just found I got upgraded on alaskaair for my flight defcon on Wed. Nephew stuck in back though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep it in the deep freeze too, so it's REALLY cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have this one and it does the trick! Cranky shoulders suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you look at the books, you'll find many sit on large amounts of past profits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Water utilities, airports, cemeteries, golf courses, other enterprises. Must function w/o taxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's not really true. A lot of governments do run enterprises that are required to turn a profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Runs the gamut!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gross! Isn't that one of their hubs even?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a real wine cellar at the Rio. A good one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're to old for defcon, might as well crawl in your coffin now and call it quits!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why yes, yes they do. AlaskaAir does an excellent job in fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just follow the 3-2-1 rule and you'll be fine. DEFCON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess I'm ready for defcon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm appalled that TOEFLGMATGRELSA believes they should not teach ESL students about homophones. How do you learn English without them??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only thing that could make is better is a little fresh salsa!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had some pretty good grilled cheese. Fav so far is pepper jack, cheddar, and havarti on sourdough. Mmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crisis averted. Lockpicks found. More or less where I thought they should be. Well, less, but still, same vicinity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder where my lockpicks are? defcon packing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out one of my oldest friends will be in Vegas say the same time I am. Love it when schedules collide! Vegas drinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are your fav apps or push services for monitoring global disasters or disaster threats? smem disaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use them to evaluate and see if they're worth making my students buy. I'm glad I don't have to buy eval copies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Europe Trip Update! Random Funnies: I finally got around to grabbing all of the photos off my camera. Most of ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is muggy and gross here this morning. I suppose it will be hot and dry by this afternoon. There should be one perfect moment in between.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sangria is all ready for tomorrow. Mmmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great! If you have questions about iaem, please let me know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look what I found in my truck?! Glasses cleaning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This doesn't look suspicious! DrugDisposal cleaning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think there's a cat snoring in my house somewhere. I keep hearing this faint sound that I can't identify ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah. Crazy though. Not unexpected, but surely annoying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'll have to contact member services at info@iaem.com.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So some directed at your team and some directed at people viewing your content?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw you post that you were dealing with attacks while deployed. Were they DOS or other? Any similarities? Super curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you get it sorted out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ouch. SQL error. Borked database. If the refresh doesn't work, can e-mail member services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liked the food. Lost a little weight. Coupons expired about the time sample arrived tho. HillsPet ScienceDiet PerfectWeight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That one's outside my pay grade!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pick me, pick MaryJo, pick anybody from SMEMCHAT. We're all happy to do it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I see you just did like the rest of us and switched to twitter. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then you can participate in the calls, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, join IAEM for free by picking a sponsor. After you join, fill out the form to joint the Emerging tech caucus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was horribly broken earlier. Still limping in places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sponsor is referring to being a member of IAEM. Nothing to do with webinar. Once a member, you can join the caucus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's how good apps are built!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've sponsored people I've never even heard of! Not sure how that happened, but it's all good. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, yeah. When you join, you pick the name of the existing member who "invited" you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pick one of the names flying by in SMEMCHAT and select them from the "who sponsored you" list! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that your polite way of saying it seems like the worst idea ever??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You better be interested in participating!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll bet that has the PH world a little anxious ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We use our phone dialing system (same as employees) and they get a call. Push a button to take the gig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sounds cool, Unfortunately, many of our volunteers do not have smartphones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will any of my SMEM compatriots be at defcon next week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish TweetDeck were available as an Android app. Makes life so much easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blerg. work iPad so dead it's been on the charger for 15 minutes and still won't boot up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got that done before my day off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what happens here when somebody is leading too. I think no leader today. SMEMchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, plus I'm bouncing between screens working on iaem presentation with my co-presenters on hangouts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops. My bad. I missed the track change. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Seattle area, Alisha_Beth did basic class for all affiliated groups. Basics remain the same for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Really, just wow. And I thought getting calls about the power being out was bad ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course the ICS slide would require much explanation to my young members.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will look on Monday and see if I made a training outline. Sometimes I don't though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was my exp as well. Had to have basics of SM first, then talk about VOST. Also sent several to PER304.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was primarily my cross trained hamradio CERT people. As a ham pointed out, SMEM is really just message traffic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine was ~2 hours, as that's how long our monthly meetings are! And yes, prep for VOST. SMEMchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mine's not a particularly good strategy for household relations though. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've done one. Alisha_Beth has done one too. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah. I can actually participate in smemchat this week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always assume everything is somebody's else's fault, until it's proven otherwise, Makes life simpler. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I would say more like limping ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! I think I was travelling at the time and failed to make an actual note of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't you recently post a link to a service that will remove your addy from mailing lists? Can you repost? I googled but failed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think you reported that too soon! Still wonky out there on the interwebs ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now the giant and needy ButtersOK has opened the back of the sofa (it's super strong velcro) and is inside my chair. LifeWithCats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It figures that facebook would have a meltdown when I actually need to do something on it..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And possibly twurds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This might be a first. I answered power outage questions via phone, hamradio, smem, and email. emlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure there were on my face when I left and Alisha_Beth checked the parking lot for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we appreciate it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ouch, big one. I'm guessing this is ours too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm hearing the Jeapordy tune in my head now . . . :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wish I could find my glasses. My eyes are going to hurt by the time I finally go home. EMlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for working late!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey psetalk, any idea how many customers are out due to Algona/Auburn outage or ETA for crew arrival?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blown transformer and down lines in Algona. PSE enroute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also many fire units on scene or enroute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Transformers in Algona. Also mult brush fires along UP tracks, which are closed. PSE enroute for down lines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey wsdot_traffic, if you're wondering why your cameras on 167 near Algona are wonky, just had a transformer blow down there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big power bump in auburnwa, poss RentonWa too. Maybe I'm not going home right now. EMlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But if you can't field program, your radio is a brick without your computer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baofeng. $30. Got it to take to defcon so I don't accidentally lose my good one. Figured out programming finally. Hamradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow misplaced my glasses between Renton and my office. Going to have to a thorough sweep of the truck when i get home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a strong dislike for electronic gadgets that come with vague instructions. And Google is not my friend tonight. hamradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the hunt for a new Twitter android app. Needs to hide RTs when doing a search. Suggestions? smem em<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made an offer to an awesome AmeriCorps applicant today and she accepted. Yay! Happydance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just remembered how much I dislike teaching IS 700. Boring. Zzzzzz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My skills are a little rusty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what you're saying is that we're mutually preventing each other from getting our tasks done. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's always extra credit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why yes, yes you did. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've come to that part of the semester where I ask "WHY IS IT SO HARD TO PUT YOUR NAME ON YOUR PAPER?!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got one for the hubs for his bday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't AlaskaAir have a PDX to DCA direct flight? I avoid connections at almost any cost!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switching from seesmic to hootsuite on my phone to see if I like it better. Hoping it deals with RTs better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A good friend and colleague of mine suffered from throat cancer, which his doc attributed to bring a 9/11 responder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was previously full of heirloom tomatoes. I ate them. Yum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just ordered a second (cheap) hamradio to take to defcon this year. Don't want to risk losing the expensive one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd. At SEA. Everybody got the equivalent of Pre-Check in the security area we were in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, that's the topic du jour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were talking about that this morning too. EMLife SMEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's that quote from? Sounds like really bad spin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah. Thunder and buckets of rain. WAWeather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's mind boggling in size. Lucky for me, we're on the west (aka wet) side of the state and it's east.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the nerdherd goes to DC. Sounds fun! But DC in July is kinda gross ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And decorated dust masks. And red punch with dry ice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lava cake. And volcano evacuation signs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out I have no banking relationships that will do currency conversion for a reasonable rate. Annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lunch time walkabout siting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what? There's a shindig?? sct_r schuback CherylBle rusnivek ENeitzel poplifegirl MaryJoFly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you need support, SMEM or otherwise, holler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 8 hours trying to change HSIN password, finally pulled out my Android tablet, fired up Chrome, and changed it in 2 minutes. IEsucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think trying to update a HSIN password is one of the most frustrating tasks in my job. Going on 2 hours now . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair, many of my ham peeps cross trained for smem. Similar skill set! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have a seat in mine already!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Virtual support team members may well be your "pajama volunteers", who never leave their house, but are very valuable. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coincidence that nearly all the active Tweeters ended up in the digital media session? Probably not. groupies piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leverage other departments, other organizations, other disciplines to support your digital efforts. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Growing numbers of people using Internet only via mobile device. Particularly true of differently abled, non-English speaking, etc. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vost teams do not have to live anywhere near you or your incident. Helpful to have team members all around the world. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Melbell1979 Alisha_Beth Sort of like our old Blackberries. We all hated them, but they were/are part of the job! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RedCross offers Disaster Digital Volunteer Training. Great resource! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Virtual Operations Support Team (#vost) is a team of volunteers to help you with your social media stuff. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now everybody in the room knows I'm a gaming nerd. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alisha_Beth here's your $2.3 million kitten. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Social media is digital cultural competency. Even if you don't use it, you need to be aware of it and embrace it, like all cultures. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are very valid reasons to withhold official information (such as death notifications), but public will still talk about it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Print media took Reddit speculations and reported them as fact. Created huge problems. Forced FBI to release suspect info. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reddit users often just want to help with an incident, using the skills they have. And there are users with super skills! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reddit users recreated Boston bomb site and correctly identified one person of interest, with no direct input from official sources. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reddit communities are self policing and will warn of things like malware sites trying to capitalize on a particular incident. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have an illusions that you control data, let it go. You can't control the public or what they talk about. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ok to say you don't know something. Can help in rumor control. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you use Internet, you have a digital tail. Public agencies have to be honest in what they do. Untruths will come back to haunt. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reddit shows what was reported and when. Shows detailed record of changes. Makes it easier to create timelines. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|><---- switched to tablet with keyboard. Much easier to tweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anything that can be used for good can also be used for evil. piepc truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reddit can be a powerful research tool. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reddit is a data aggregator. Gathers info from many sources. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People go to Twitter for very fast information. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reddit scares me! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Social media can pose hazard to responders during an incident when tactical info is reported by citizens. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Social media is no different than us calling our friends on the phone 20 years ago. Just quicker and broader reach. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Social media can't be controlled by authorities. Can be useful tool though. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Polite way, right way to use social media. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During Dorner standoff, Sheriff directed citizens to quit using Twitter. Didn't work. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reddit is an important tool. High profile people do live interviews there. Also active users do a lot of analysis. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Session on Digital Volunteers by Alisha_Beth and schuback . piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Columbia has built reinforced areas into buildings to protect from earthquakes. Signs say "stand here in case of earthquake". piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emergency Managers are very good about saying "be prepared" and very kind about the fact that nobody is listening. piepc truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad things can happen suddenly and very quickly. We have to be prepared. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe we can do it an add-on next year! NDPTC piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid auto correct! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Involve non-EM people early in response and recovery. Recovery needs to transition to community development activity. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Involve Bob-EM people early in response and recovery. Recovery needs to transition to community development activity. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emergency planners in Columbia are dedicated to making sure similar tragedy never happens. Preparedness starts with little kids. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Visitors from Columbia were scared driving through Orting valley. Reminded them of their city prior to volcano/lahar tragedy. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As EM in a lahar path city, a little surprised to learn all that's going on that I'm not looped in on. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nevado Del Ruiz delegation did some presentations in Pierce County, which drew attention to the issue. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of photos of Nevado Del Ruiz delegation, but not a lot of lessons shared yet. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at photos from Nevado Del Ruiz. Different definitions of "road"! Piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many similarities between Mt. Rainier and Nevado Del Ruiz. Piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweet lots! I wanted to see that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our mountains in Washington are just big piles of rubble waiting to fall down. piepc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Doughton: we already know what we need to do, we just have to do it. piepc earthquake tsunami<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've really only recognized Cascadia threat for 25 years. Are making progress on prep and resilience efforts. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Washington state is a laggard in earthquake retrofits. BC and Oregon doing much better. Dedicated funding. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Japan areas hit by quake had been retrofitted and suffered far less damage. Primary damage was from tsunami. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than 270K people in Japan still living in temp housing from tsunami 3 years ago. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Washington is slowly being pushed east by the coastal plate, and north by California. Forks, WA moving east about 1" per year. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full-rip Cascadia quakes occur about every 250 years. Now been more than 300 years since last one. piepc timebomb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Records on Japanese scrolls, combined with geologic evidence show "full rip" Cascadia quake occurred in the winter of 1700. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ancient Japanese records contained info on mystery tsunami that had no quake with it. Quake was actually off Washington coast. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final proof of last big Cascadia Quake actually came from historic tsunami records in Japan. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paleoseismology = study of earthquake history. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Understanding of Cascadia subduction zone is recent. Really came about in 1980s/90s thanks to USGS Geologist who specialized in mud. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Native American history is full of stories of past earthquakes. Largely ignored by early settlers. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 1920s, Seattle professor claimed Seattle's location make it immune from earthquakes for all time. piepc oops ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>History of Cascadia quake discovery includes outlaws, crooks, and big business. Don't discount ouliers! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a sick bay in here ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doughton just called out the audience on our love of acronyms. piepc truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting to hear about earthquakes from a journalist. Tell a good story and people are more likely to listen. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cascadia megaquake would directly impact Washington, Oregon, BC, Alaska, with indirect impacts across the country and world. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sandi Doughton talking about earthquake hazards. Economic impact of a Cascadia megaquake huge. People don't like to think about it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gail Harris kicking off piepc. Dedicated this year's conference to all affected by sr530slide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to get started. Piepc (@ Welcome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, as an officer of the South Puget Sound Enlightened, I extend my official welcome and greetings. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please tell me you're a frog and not a smurf!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is buckets of rain out there tonight though! Soaked through my coat. wawx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attending a conference inside. No coverage in conference rooms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one set of training activities will meet the needs of all audiences. Be flexible. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not everybody is an analyst. Don't grab the first warm body with a pulse and make them analyze stuff. Make sure they are a good fit. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Training and exercise are not the same thing. Exercises validate the training you've already done (or point out gaps). piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Training and exercise is an important part of a rapid needs assessment program. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Break over. Rice crispy treats. Yum! Back to the learning. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at the place I previously indicated. GTCTC You will have to google the zip code or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In-depth review of data should be done, but takes time and talent. Helps anticipate future probs. Can be done by vol tech comm. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is that a lot of those numbers are taken already. Hard to boot people off. Some sort of standard WOULD be nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Geographic analysis: pockets of problems. Pockets with no incoming data. Both require action, but different kinds. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't hold on to obvious problems to analyze them. Pass to people who can deal with it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evident analysis: obvious problems. i.e. people trapped, water over roads, etc. No real analysis required. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you have rapid needs assessment data. Now what? Analysis! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment: don't rely on text messages to get through in a timely manner. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever system you're going to use to transmit rapid needs assessment info, make sure your people train and practice with it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment data transmit options: Voice, Fax, E-mail, proprietary software. hamradio, which has voice and data ability. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment requires a method for getting info back to the EOC for compilation and analysis. Make it simple and redundant! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we're not really talking about formal reports. We're talking about rapidly figuring out what we know about an incident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my world, Planning Section. Somebody has to take the pile of info and make sense of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment data collection requires descriptive information, not just a pile of vague info. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment requires data analysis. Turn facts and figures into useful info. Requires proper data to start with. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment reqs planning for data collection, reg/state systems, focus on data needed to figure out true situation. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mark of a good instructor: continuing without the slides when the projector fails. Kudos to James Yates from waEMD piepc adapt overcome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More factors in rapid needs assessment: available resources; local importance; political issues. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prioritize your rapid needs assesment, but be flexible. Time/Season/special events/continuing & developing threats all play a role. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't want the pres at disaster when we're trying to do response. Too much overhead when we need people for real work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PIEPC That probably only really works if somebody is introducing you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facility owners are often the best to do their own rapid needs assessment. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make sure your rapid assessment teams are qualified to assess the things they're assigned to. Not inspections, just rapid assessment. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment still has to wait until the affected area is safe to assess. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annoying that Tmobile data coverage sucks in the GTCTC. Having to use my AT&T device to connect. fixit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment: ID problem areas, then plan for an ORGANIZED assessment process. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment planning helps us identify where the highest risk to life might take place so we can go look for it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting to look and realize that everybody at my piepc table deployed to the SR 530 slide. We're all just one big community!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your rapid needs assessment plan should take into account historical data. May help pinpoint your starting point. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rapid needs assessment is based on your hazard and risk analysis first and foremost. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to cram the brain! Taking G557: Rapid Needs Assessment. Finally going to finish my FEMA APS certificate. Took 8 years! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to head out for the piepc conference. Great speakers slated for this year, plus a class I've been waiting on for 8 years!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of the things that happens though is that gov't gets sued for not approving cuz developers don't believe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The pressure to allow development in dumb places is enormous, for a variety of reasons. Money, tax revenue, public perception<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or because we have no way to mitigate them, either because there is no feasible way or no funds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's the speech to text that would be hard to overcome. Like asking Google Voice to do it, with audience that uses modded English.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like proof to me! To clarify, it should be technically possible, but not offered by vendors due to low demand/high dev cost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You would have to contact each and every vendor and ask if they can do it. That's the only proof you'll get!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In working with my deaf and hard-of-hearing community, find that almost none had TTY. Used email, SMS, and video relay. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's technically possible, but not aware of any vendors. Would require on the fly voice to text, which often sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then it would make coffee for the janitor every night!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Must Not Feed the Trolls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using derogatory words like "sonny" and "kiddo" = unprofessional, bullyish, mean, condescending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually Robert, that was grammar, not spelling. And Nazi? Really? No genocide going on here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's correctly stated "could have", not "could of" .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You attacked him. That's not showing interest, it's expressing ageism and acting like a bully.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Found your post, but you forgot the # ndptc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, unfortunately, all the iaem info about it used the old course number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not handy. Sorry! Devices loaned out at the moment. Search NDPTC Hawaii.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nite nite Reno. Gotta get up to teach NDPTC course in the morning. And then get to go home and sleep in my own bed. Hurrah!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tried wi-fi with no joy. And I was using the scanner, not the actual location.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got Circus Circus fine. Had to stand in the block by the Silver Legacy garage to get it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It was great to meet you at iaem13. Hopefully we'll cross paths again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that's not just me feeling that way. Whew!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting rdy for annual iaem banquet at iaem13 where we swear in officers and welcome the new CEMs. MaryJoFly will be up there. Who else?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's some really good stuff on the BC side that EM should learn and institutionalized. Same for EM to BC. iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But be prepared to pay! High risk = high premium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. You can identify high risk by what you can't insure! IAEM13 businessContinuity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. I find ESFs useful. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Round table with Dr. Thomas Drabek. Great to be able to "pick the brain" of a great mind. iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My experience is that BC and EM are essentially the same thing. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can't control any media in a disaster and never have been able to. truth IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woohoo! I won a prize in the iaem13 CLICK game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you! Been trying to figure out what I won and who had it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are looking for the presentation slides, most are on the app. iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's good! Sounds like a sick bay in here! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emergency mangers as change agents. iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Resilience is more than a go kit. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you hear all the sneezing on the live stream? IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drabek: it's time to push insurers to all-hazards model. Discrete coverages leave homeowners in limbo when something happens. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drabek: if any of this is new, you need to do a little homework! iaem13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Initial reactions of disaster survivors and volunteers. iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cultural differences change disaster behavior. Distinct differences from country to country. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Drabek: more is known than is being applied to reduce vulns and increase resilience. Find it, use it, share it! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn you autocorrect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only it meant "nada" weather. Going to be a rough year in the PNW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited to hear Dr. Thomas Drabek speak. Have read his work, but never heard him speak. Conference chair had a fangirl moment. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats Jdlazo on your first place award for student research! Yay!! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Casagrande: growing gap between rich and poor is more than financial. Will soon include life spans. Likely destabilizing. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With current trend, likely 100 Million more men than women in China in 20 years. Increased militarism and/or destabilization likely. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's early!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We call that "being an ostrich".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's not really what he said. He's speaking specifically to the B, not the CRN. C has already killed many, will continue. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm about to take one of these tablecloths and use it as a blanket. Brrrrrrrr! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Casagrande talking about bio weps to control behavior reminds me of The Pax in Serenity. No good can come from that! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Casagrande - the ability exists to synthicise extinct viruses. Not easy, but doable. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Casagrande - a fairly uncommon set of skills is required to actually create a viable bio weapon. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leaving already?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Casagrande - advanced tech also poses security challenges, as can be used to create bio weapons. Needs agent+weaponization. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Casagrande - scientists are working to create algae that directly creates diesel as a byproduct. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Casagrande: 3 things that changed the world: the laser, ARPA-NET, birth control pill. None were expected to. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will find out! iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should do lots of things. Like not forget meetings! justsaying IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you answer? MT EMgrB: can slides viewable on the app can be downloaded? want to share with others at my org not here...#iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel bad. Got engrossed I conversation and missed half of Training and Education Committee meeting at iaem13. Oops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pretty lonely at the crisis tech center. Come visit! iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody ever accused me of being quiet! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! Long lunch line. iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad that people are afraid to engage in convos about controversial topics like climate change. Important to EM. Consequence mgmnt. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In order to sustain our planet, have to change the way we consume. Example: wasting energy to keep this conference room arctic! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sensing a disturbance in the smem force at IAEM13 . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some countries are becoming unviable due to rising sea levels. How do you relocate a country? Enrironmental refugees? Where to go? IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some places that seem manifestly crazy to build/rebuild in, but we allow it anyway. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting discussion about why people don't believe in climate change. Brains not wired to think about an abstract future. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Washington, we have an infinite number of names for precip in all forms. This looked and felt like sleet! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Breakout session with ericklinenberg. Heat hastens deaths of those who had pre-existing conditions. Mostly preventable though. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. I'm blaming the weather service! The failed to mention this in the morning brief! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confirmed with iaem staff that the click game is having tech issues. Working on it. Keep trying and be patient! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who ordered up the sleet?? IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool! Randolph Mantooth just won an award. Lady behind me said "OMG, I have his lunchbox!". For you kids, he was our TV hero! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to Doc Lumpkins his career excellence award! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. I think part of solution is to pass full risk to people who choose to go back. Insurers can drive change. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regardless of the reasons for climate change, EM has to plan for it. Frustrating that it often becomes a political decision. -- me IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instinct is to build back after disaster. Not always best choice. Science and history can help us make better decisions. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool pic of park that doubles as flood storage during big storms. Walls come up to collect and hold water. Skate park when dry. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is making a very solid case for developing plans based on study of history, even if we think it can't happen again. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You don't need to believe in science to do emergency planning, but it helps." -- ericklinenberg IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Europe heat wave in 2003 mirrored Chicago in fatalities, but lasted 3 weeks instead of 3 days. They failed to learn from past. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Photo of grave full of coffins in Chicago was unsettling. Hard to imagine in the US in 1995. Many unclaimed victims. Died alone. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real first responders are your family and neighbors. Strong neighborhoods can save lives in spite of poverty. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1995 Chicago heat wave: fatality map clearly correlates to areas with highest poverty levels. We still don't plan for that. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1995 Chicago heat wave: the elites left town on vacation. Left secondary decision makers in place who made bad decisions. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1995 Chicago heat wave was both a natural and man made disaster. Many cascading failures. iaem13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've done several already! Plus, a TV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Often, events that we think will change history actually don't. -- ericklinenberg IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the Click game broken? Can't get it to update or accept new entries. Tried multiple devices. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anybody is looking for an extra banquet ticket for IAEM13 tomorrow night, I know somebody who has an extra.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning iaem13. Don't forget to VOTE today! And remind everybody you talk to today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope EmergenC and Aleve can keep this crud from getting any worse. No time too be sick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got one! I want green, right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I downloaded ingress. Now to find an activation code! waiting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a worthy challenge! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great CERT shoutout for the Stony Brook campus team! iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in Reno 4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. Wrong account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stony Brook U has ability to generate own power. Takes prior decision. Saved them in sandy. IAEM13 ^skm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't one. Initiative started in EM higher Ed grp, faded when it's champion literally died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate projectors that are slightly out of focus. Makes me think I'm going blind! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That works too! Should be a standard though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope we get accreditation for EM academic programs back on track. Fix quality issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget to attend your region meeting at 1645 this afternoon. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nor with OJT and experience. Takes both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Break time! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes you do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because there are bodies of knowledge that evolve and if you don't learn new stuff, your org dies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Login to peer reviewed journal database and search "public employee performance". Or meet my interns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. And firefighters who want to get promoted get degrees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you yell at people online who insist that current is same as past! Don't perpetuate the myth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it isn't. If you are the public servant, you just do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I've only see apprenticeships related to trades. EM is not a trade. It's a profession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just need a better imagination!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Internship guide:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not familiar with any agencies that have apprentice programs. Name some so I can read difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using interns for stupid stuff is a waste of their time and your money. Schools req objectives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not in my experience, either academically or practically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why iaem produced an internship guide for employers. It's on the website. Promote it, use it! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I challenge you to find any EM degree that is NOT multi-disciplinary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or it's because we ignore the theory!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a walking comm center, complete with redundant power. iaem13 @ Eldorado Hotel & Casino<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>See my previous set of tweets . . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweeting for 3 different accounts is going to test my ability to maintain multiple personalities!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fagan: we have to think beyond the next election in recovery and think toward the next generation. iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fagan: the most important thing in recovery is kin (both family and friends). iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fagan: we have compounded vulnerability in highly populated areas that will experience sea rise. Great challenge for disasters pros. iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which, judging from what I see/hear would be "let's keep doing it the old way. We don't need science or tech"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love British humor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are doing all the talking though . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without solid theory, practice is limited to the knowledge of the person teaching you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My hands are so dry that my iPhone does not want to recognize my inputs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fagan: my email is filled with nuttos. We can all relate! IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fagan: the thing that held people together in disasters of old was kin. Better connected than now. IAEM13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brian Fagan speaking about history of disasters. Perspective of an archeologist is unique! iaem13<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good job OfficeDepot. Your Customer Service rep just hung up on me. All I want to know is how my order changed and how you're going to fix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was my first choice, but none of the stores close to me have a print shop. Not driving to Fife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They referred me to a resolutions specialist or something. Now I'm hold while they try to figure out my print job.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't know. Nobody has ever tried. I world like to make the pitch for somebody though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always been my hope that someone from EM365 would use it to waive out of Basic PIO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. APIO is the best class ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's very funny! Should have much greater concern over the predicted 60 MPH wind gusts this evening!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Crap. Another 30 minute delay. Now I'm going to miss my last AlaskaAir PDX to SEA connection of the day, unless it's delayed too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've heard from one of mine, but not the other. She's stranded with no power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got new Y510P, but didn't want Windows 8 or the HHD. Was swapping for my existing SSD with Win 7. Fixed it. :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, so much for that. Evening wasted. No working computer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. If I were happy with it out of the box, it would be all good. But I'm not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. Wireless card not recognized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BIOS recombobulated. Boot successful. Windows confused. Configuration commencing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would Lenovo make a laptop that only boots from a network card? How stupid is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And fail. Won't boot. Blergh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moment of truth in 3.....2......1.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smaller screw bit found. Problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This entire drive swap is now being held up by a 1 cent screw. Screw bit for the drill is too big. Really don't want too drill it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First problem: insufficient strength to remove SSD bracket screws.Had to call in muscle. Still one stuck. Muscle had to go back to WOW raid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it sad to be replacing parts on a brand new laptop without even turning it on first? geekdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swapping existing SSD into brand new laptop. First observation is old Dell required a lot fewer screws to be removed to access drive slot.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And now I too must go. Have to finish syllabus for em365, that starts Wed. My PIO course where I make them tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Generational groupings are just one of many that can inhibit/enhance understanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. And forcing people to consider those differences in their own context (groups) promotes understanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still believe that though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have fun. Hope it's good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. People don't realize the variety in the people around them and this causes conflict.Generational is only 1 example<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with speed/access. Still many people who have never gotten on plane. Most people have Internet access.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've watched people have true moments of clarity when they actually consider the diffs of the people around them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You sound pretty sure of that! To ignore the differences that shaped our lives is counterproductive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find the named generations useful when teaching instructors. Helps generate understanding.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bandaids are for wimps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or we can just ask the NSA. They know where we all are, all the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the reality is that with a fairly eash to get court order, you get the location of your kid on a cell phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not unsimilar to LoJack for laptops or the "locate" function Apple has on Ipads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is that people are stupid with their passwords and there are numerous insecurities to be exploited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I didn't have to read an article to come to that conclusion. Saved me lots of time. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or just imbed a locater beacon under their kids skin ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the best answer is for parents to be able to remotely toggle geo location on/off on kids phones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not always Dave! Covert watching is an art form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given that I pretty much ignore "the stream" and focus on my content windows, it's much easier. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It didn't though. Just smaller audience. We had chat rooms, IRC, bulletin boards, etc. oldschool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Six week backorder on that model . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love my fitbit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bacon yes, carrots no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note to self: never agree to meet with the auditor on Monday. headache<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It depends on what I'm doing with it. I make Mac n cheese with smoked cheddar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, I was more interested in the cheese! LoafLove<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This one is for you. ICS400 volunteers workinghard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found TillamookCheese loaflove at Sam's. Mmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super awesome ICS 400 class this weekend. Love it when a class "gets it". Lots of learning, plus we'll be done early! volunteers winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It gets better. I just remembered that I bought an after-market warranty on it. And I found it. And it's still valid! winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the fridge died. Thank god we had a beer fridge to convert back to a food fridge. savethefood warmbeer meltedicecream<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Amen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to make a clip for the One that holds one better. My husband just flushed his One down the toilet. *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to have to stay off Twitter this afternoon or I'm going to end up crying through the end of class. sean1076<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Does it count as disasterdrinks when it was only two of us?? CherylBle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear students: SPELLCHECK!!!!! That is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love hanging with the oldest of friends, even if only for a short bit. bff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not used to being told my $13 bottle of wine is expensive. But then I'm not used to buying wine at the gas station either. HotelLiving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no, I brought my iPad with data enabled for that. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hauled my work laptop all the way to VanWA, forgot to grab the Mi-Fi that allows connection to the mothership. oops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got it back! It had saved my doc and the recovered doc separately. Whew!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Word just ate half of a really important document. It disappeared before my very eyes. Now it's locked up. cry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did my giant kitty have to discover that packages of toilet paper can come out of the package and be great "toys"? lifewithcats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bummed that I'm a little too far south to see the aurora tonight. At least not without a massive power outage to kill the city lights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear I had already followed you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad day for first responders across the country. LODD WSP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had my first Tillamook Light yogurt this afternoon (yes, they sent me coupons for freebies). Tasty! And sadly, gone already. yum gonatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate writer's block ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok google hangout experts, how come my Android device no longer alerts me to the fact that some has sent me a message, like talk did?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just noticed a typo in a tweet I sent yesterday. Now I'm going to fret about it. embarrassed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My attempt to open another becu account to satisfy refi reqs is being thwarted by a mystery database that has inaccurate info. annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm too old to follow any business that says U instead of You.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Google Hangouts, which was forced upon me by Google, does not behave as Google Talk did. No notices to mobile device. Missing messages!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love BECU , but making me open a whole new account and stick $5 in it just to refi my home loan (that they already hold) is silly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reserved my room for iaem 2013 conference. Who will I have the pleasure of seeing there this year?? iaem13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always entertaining to open conference program and find yourself listed as a speaker when nobody confirmed it with you! flexible surprise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool EM job in Hawaii. Warm, sun, happy place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, see, I'm ok with gooey, depending on what is being reviewed. Brownies, for instance, are perfectly described as gooey. Mmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It just rained so hard here it sounded like a pipe had burst in the house. Holy cow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's awesome! So not everything that happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?? smembaby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Google Play store informed me that Hangouts is the replacemnt for Talk. And that's all it explained. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really confused by Google Hangouts vs Google Talk. I found Talk intuitive. Hangouts, not so much. changeishard<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear Spotify, why are the tracks I own, which are stored on my PC, and synced to my android device, suddenly "not available" on my device?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too cute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn't get out much then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I'm going to have to stay off Twitter for a couple hours or risk NCIS finale spoilers. Damn you east coast!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it was me! It said 999, I clicked like and now it says 1000!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love being told by somebody who has never worked in EM what EMs should want an intern to know. Especially when they raise their voice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at that meeting in Lakewood. I think you would have already had a meltdown!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wish you were here today!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is definitely a "no good deed goes unpunished" sort of day. monday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lucky you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bummed that the pdxwinterhawks game is being broadcast on a 4 hour tape delay in Seattle. What's the point?? whl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello Silverton!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that a Type 1 or a Type 3 nerdherd?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will it be broadcast on Root Sports again so we can watch it from that big city to your north??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhhhh. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny, that's what I'm watching. :) Would still rather watch WHL hockey. pdxwinterhawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bummed to find that the pdxwinterhawks game isn't on cable tonight. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will do! Now only if there were a cheese pack . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grades posted for the week. Now for a little WOW time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wahhhh. I'll be on vacation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't search when I think it's just me. Spend a lot of time trying to remember why I invited somebody to connect with me tho ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just saw your post about LinkedIn from 2 days ago. I thought it was just me!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody of any size should tell you you're unhealthy, unless they're your medical provider! Skinny or fat, nobody should judge!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You gotta bring that baby by for a visit! You know where to find us .... :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ironic that a robocall from "Faith and Freedom Action" would use the term "unforgivable" so many times. What faith is that exactly? forgive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And before Google, you just had to go to the library. pst314<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They had neither cheerleaders or a mascot back when I had season tix ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But why do the pdxwinterhawks have cheerleaders? Isn't watching the zamboni enough excitement in pdx anymore??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not all that surprising. The whole reason they are the WMD of choice is that they are cheap and easy to make. pst314<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After this year, they damned well better win the whole thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And tonight, I'm a pdxwinterhawks fan. Watching the game on TV. whl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow it never clicked in my brain that was an auto tweet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I actually need to call up there and arrange a tour for my EMCOMM group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gee, thanks for broadcasting that to the world. There's a reason real pentesters report privately first. BECU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And it's not that weird to use an authoritative third party. We do it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just learned about GoogleNow. That one is new to me. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, don't have it handy (it's on our big screen with an audience). Had to pre register though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Google crisis maps for Sandy had 50+ layers. smem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wish I could stay, since I love smemchat, but I gotta go. Stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should clarify that, I ignore those who add speculative commentary. Not helpful! Those who add contextual commentary are good. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A6: not much we can do, except try to bring them into our fold. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A5 I also do real-time triage of the stream. Those who seem to be adding commentary, I generally ignore. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still think, just like in the rest of EM, building relationships and reputation ahead of time is what's important. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It can mean that, but only a small number of agencies actually get verified, yet they are clearly official. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A3: I'm ambivalent about the verified tag. Verified doesn't mean correct, just a real person. And doesn't prevent hacking. Ask AP. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: I have a local list for my local area. Or I did. Not sure how current it is. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have a link to the original study? Finding lots of references to it, but not the actual study.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly! The untrained public is untrained in everything! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tap water has very low concentrations, as opposed to added ingredient where you can taste it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1 and even the trained ears struggle sometimes! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: one of big issues with scanners is regular folk not understanding what they're hearing. Takes a trained ear to sort the chaos. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It makes me very ill. So yeah, it's evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: Encryption is expensive though and systems would have to be replaced. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: taking it down doesn't so a lot of good, as locals can still hear it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the flavored water though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's pretty much why I got one. Thought we would make soda too, but most flavs have evil sucralose in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might actually be here for part of smemchat today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to all my students at jaxstate who are graduating tonight. Go forth and do good! And don't forget what I taught you about smem!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I saw the possible dead bomber photo yesterday. Made me angry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teaching ICS 300 for volunteers with the usual suspects this weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously thinking about getting a mini bluetooth keyboard for my Android phone. My fingers work better with buttons or keys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And as we all know, we would be out of jobs if most of the world practiced common sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will try them again later this weekend when they're not so bogged down,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I does say you can't repeat it for your own gain, which may be what prevents the media from using.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I disagree. Says scanners exempt from listening. Doesn't say you can repeat what you hear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their site is pretty bogged down tonight! I tried there first. Can't get in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it covers more than that, because it also covers cordless phones for certain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a link? This was a topic around the office today and I want to find a real answer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saying that the law clearly says you cannot disclose what you hear. Largely ignored I think, but still there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember back in the day, media couldn't report on what they heard on scanner due to this law. Had to confirm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That article says they pled guilty. Also, predates FISA and Patriot Act, which made some changes to EPCA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I meant the person providing the feed shut it down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looked up answer to my question and Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 does say it's illegal to disclose scanner info to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My point was that people who tweet what they hear may be breaking the law. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night they did shut down the main Boston feed, but several others are still up and running.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An smem scanner head should know this. It used to be illegal to divulge what you heard via scanner. Did that change and I missed it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, use<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a special place in hell for public servants who take unauthorized private photos and release them to the public. Way to build trust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want to find battery operated digital wall clock that syncs time via wifi for EOC. Too much to ask??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just came to the same conclusion. Holy crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are essentially real time. Delay is network induced and variable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Signing off for real now. Lord knows what will happen in the six hours before I get up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you tweet too much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TweetDeck spell check problem fixed. Installed into Chrome. Uses Chrome spell check. first world problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, at least you got solid confirmation on something! A rare thing tonight. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cambridge scanner is still yapping in my ear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And tomorrow I need to find a spell checker for TweetDeck ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eyelids are dropping, phone is beeping incessantly that it needs power. Work comes early. Sleep is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHDH just stated that they have confirmed one suspect has been shot and killed. At least that's what I think I heard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, saw it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are citing a source, though not by name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My scanner seems to be about 45 seconds behind yours ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several print media outlets are reporting it as true though. The Boston Globe seems to have been first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Find better stations! I'm watching WHDH out of Boston via their live stream. They are on-scene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I think it's Mt. Auburn, but can't find it in the scroll now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crowd at hospital is likely due to injured person from the incident being taken there. Prolly media, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw a 7700 squack for a inbound flight from Brussels to SFO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did hear that they have a large crowd gathering at one hosp and were requesting extra officers for crowd control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen some pretty bad oppsies on twitter though too. Just quicker to correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are a joke ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus FBI and something called the Diplomatic Service or something like that. Many acronym jackets running around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what I'm thinking. No weps visible on him. Might be case of bad timing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They probably don't even know they're being talked about. It's the middle of the night and the PIO is sleeping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHDH just said ref guy proned out on ground "we don't know who it is, but it's someone". Honesty is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've got it up on the big screen and I've seen it a few times now. Looks like a windbreaker with lettering on the back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not the one I saw. I saw a guy in sweats, proned out on the street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the source on that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're also saying he doesn't fit the description originally given and has no visible weapons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHDH has incredible video. Holy cow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proving themselves irrelevent. I'm watching Boston news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe just a case of wrong place, wrong time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this pretty well makes my earlier case for local vs national ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. Go the other feed up on the TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have their website too, but it's a little laggy at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Radio Reference is the app you want for mobile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to pull that up, but site is SLOWWWWWW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get a scanner app and listen live. having trouble with it on desktop, but mobile app is working well. Slight lag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that should be a surprise to exactly nobody!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really annoying that no national news has live watertown cambridge info right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no guarantee at this point that they're actually the right people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. I'm hearing one thing and seeing tweets with alternate info. Takes trained ear to sort out the chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like they've got the 2nd one in watertown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's way worse when you're the dispatcher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No kidding. And I just keep thinking we haven't even hit the 19th and 20th yet, which have historical bad juju.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week can't be over soon enough. But I don't get a break until a week from tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LODD, carjacking, poss middle eastern males armed with guns. Tweet stream is a blur ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I won't feel so bad about missing smemchat tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how we always come full circle to "it's about the relationships". :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think if local EM takes time to ask you to use a diff hastag, your response shouldn't be F U.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If me and local media can be on same page, don't really care about national.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good relationships with local media are critical so they will look to me first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For me, always local. National is irrelevent to anything I'm doing in the first 24 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Survivors dude, not victims!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My PIO is typically in bed when the excrement hits the fan ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on which folks. I want my info to go to local people.Local people look to local sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still argue with some ICS instructors about value of sm at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a local person, I follow local media first to follow stuff in my area. As EM, I also send info to local media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you thin this week can't get any worse. LODD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think national should adapt or be ignored. I'm thinking strictly as a local EM here and what is helpful to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was pretty much my point too! Sometimes going with the flow is the right thing to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, emergency bacon would be a very critical thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with that. Noted some confusion in the feed last night from ppl in the tagged but uninvolved town<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Decided to poll all local venues for large event list for remainder of year. Enthusiastic positive response! planning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish i could join. Hard during work hours though. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of moral of story here is recognition of diff between rapid and short events vs slow building and long ones. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Point of smem should not be to generate resource response tho. Should be to help public stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seemed to rapidly evolve more refined description that was more helpful, but was ignored by far away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow is going to be a heartbreaking day. Can't imagine what it's going to be like for the folks of West.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It started early in the incident. National news kept saying it was in waco, but finally adapted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, I would hope my smem buddies would put the smack down on the offenders and the would adapt. I would be busy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. But if you're going to be helpful in smem, seems like you should be willing to change and do as the locals do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like if somebody came to auburnwa and kept referring to it as seattle. Not helpful! smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess the morale is to figure out who the locals are and follow them! smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems logical to me to just follow along to what the locals were using. Lots of national folks were using other stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smem what's the rationale for using a hashtag for an indirectly involved community instead of using one for the actual impacted city?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appears self deployed. So much for NIMS. jaykelly26: Check out iamed_nc who is in West, TX | WestTX Waco smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing special. It's still too hot to enter, so no way to tell what happened yet. Gonna have a lot of search in AM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wayyy to early to tell. But they are well equipped for Hazmat and locals aren't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daylight is going to be a horrible thing there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's an app for that!! but they were battling 20-30 MPH winds too, so expanded quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to scanner, they had perimeter of some sort up quickly. were telling incoming to be prepared to show ID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Noting the weariness starting to creep into voices on scanner. Hardest thing when your own are involved. westexplosion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Old habits die hard. Everytime the scanner app on my phone gets fuzzy, it pick it up and wiggle it around as though it has an antenna.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounded like a herd! Prompted hubby to actually get up from his WOW game to see what was up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would prompt a new use for the shotgun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Per wacotrib it's family owned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was on the Waco Tribune TL. Will see if I can find it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A whole herd of Chinooks just flew over the house. Always somewhat disturbing this time of night ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Figured it was the county. Typical in rural areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My point was that he could have been the volunteer EMS Director, representing EMS. There probably is no EM Dir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are very few "only" volunteers in small towns. Vols are the professionals they have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody is in West. It was evacuated. I however am in Seattle, working smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it's not in waco. It's in WEST.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every EMS has to have a Director.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have any confirmation of that fatality report, other than the widely quoted EMS Director? Not nitpicking, just querying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. Though I prefer rum to scotch ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, it's not in Waco. Don't freak out the people who live there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was interesting listening to them trying to figure out what to do with 2nd chopper when the only pad was occupied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Distance is a difficult concept sometimes when you come from a place where you can cross 3 states in a day ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also seeing waco<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had a LORAN we used to take on SAR missions. Until I broke the antenna ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just struck by dispatch evolution. When I started, we didn't have reverse 911, let alone Internet. Now all on global stage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lest anyone forget, this is national Telecommunicators Week. And boy have we heard some great dispatching this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note, that photo attributed to an incident from several years ago, NOT tonight's (which occured after dark)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you're just too cool ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it my imagination or is CNN having a really hard time this week? Monday = behind on everything, now jumping to conclusions. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just sent msg to my CERT team, thanking them for being there if our day ever comes. Also reminded them to seesomethingsaysomething.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to hope that investment yields a viable suspect at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It probably just crashed their system at that point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Waco. Different circumstances, but same sureal feeling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. I took it as "quit bothering us today"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CNN has been behind the game the whole time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, that's dumb bad guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Major news sources are reporting it as true, but first responders are still trying to use them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boston area Red Cross says they have enough blood to meet need. Was in their feed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that they didn't all go off tends to fly in the face of "well planned", thankfully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had same thought. We switched it off in our EOC in favor of something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was really great to hear them say on radio to push info via sm. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have seen what appear to be confirmed reports of bombs. Were reported by local media. Will see if i can find now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They did say on scanner that EOD was detonating one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or just donate blood and save the hospital operators for urgent issues. Always a need for donors. Boston BostonMarathon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait 'til this year's show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have students say that to me every semester. Scares me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear petco: please make it easy to change repeat deliveries. Or to find your "chat with a rep" button. Luckily deleting my order WAS easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope the Gwinnett suspect doesn't have Twitter. Real-time photos of SWAT and other responders are interesting to public, helpful to supect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm always bummed when I learn that people without real EM experience are hired into key EM positions. Why do we bother too hone our craft?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For my High School CERT grads, a great summer job opportunity:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it's not as though I starved to death in those 15 minutes. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our free iPads will be limited to one for somebody who completes the evals! Not going to buy 7+ of them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a good point, but I'm sure we can figure something out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short answer: not enough. That's why we need to recruit volunteers who do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda hard to have spontaneous volunteers for an event that requires pre-registration!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our volunteers are already comped. I think mostly we need to have tech available to them if they don't already have their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm hoping next year we can get volunteers to live tweet from every session! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should clarify that it was Pierce County Sheriff employees, not the County, who purchased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Troyer: crisis brings together unusual partners. Banditos and Gypsy Jokers offered to "deal" with Westboro Baptist Church protesters. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always good when a presenter warns the crowd before popping up dead bodies on the screen. Especially during lunch! piepc OnlyInEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. Speakers don't tend to site their sources!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is only one natural gas line that serves our entire area. That's a lot of dependence on one piece of infrastructure. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love speakers who can make the audience laugh this early in the morning! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting to hear about all of the local community organizations PSETalk supports. Great community partners! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys did an amazing job during this series and we're all proud of you! SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, right?! It would have given me an excuse to come to PDX. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just likes to fret. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True fans can't be angry about this! An incredible finish to the season! If they're angry, they're not fans. They're attendees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super proud of the SeattleTbirds! Sad to see the season end, but what a fight they put up! nextyearinKent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have your phone charger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NWS sent a valid blizzard warning, but the cell carriers rebroadcast to a very broad area instead of narrow due to tech limits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NWS doesn't control WEA/CMAS alert messages to cell phones. Cellular providers do and are working to refine targeting. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that last slide was just for you. It had a piggy on it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, fixed it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My bad. It was honcompany file cabinets, not Haan. PIEPC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meiseler: side-note: all the Haan file cabinets survived the tornado. piepc justsaying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meiseler addressing the general session on lessons learned in the Joplin tornado. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mieseler discussing difficulty of balancing family concerns with official duties after disaster strikes. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mieseler is sharing humorous but true differences between how men and women respond to emergency warnings. piepc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>SMEM PIEPC also caroldn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannot believe this series is going to have another OT game. My heart can't take this! Kelowna_Rockets SeattleTbirds fingerscrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just butt in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, count me in for lunch! I must meet the fellow EM who likes hockey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, because sometimes cheaters DO win. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can't be friends now! Except I used to have pdxwinterhawks season tix, so . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently the only whistle in this game is on the back of the backup Kelowna_Rockets goalie. SeattleTbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah for hockey in April!!!!! TBirdsGameday SeattleTbirds letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck with that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Persistence pays off sometimes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to work, then to PIEPC for the day, then to SeattleTbirds for hopefully the final playoff game of the series. goodday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See you there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And milk is a renewable resource, so time for milk powered cars??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta stick up for my neighbors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited for piepc to start tomorrow. Lots of smem tweeps will be there, so follow along to learn great stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hospital in Auburn is called Multicare Auburn Medical Center, not any of the other names I've seen listed for it today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm listening to "Southeast King County Police and Fire" using the Scanner Radio app on my Android phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate waking up to the sounds of sirens everywhere. Scanner suggests multiple shooting in Auburn tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the era of citizen reporters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Internet feed of SeattleTbirds and Kelowna_Rockets blows. Appears they have bad tech problems on the backend. Lag/stutter/stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're an IAEM student member, there's still time to register for piepc at the reduced rate of $150. iaem EM preparedness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who among the smem crowd is attending piepc next week??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. A fellow rum lover. Dangerous. Expensive. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess you get a pass, as long as it's good rum and whiskey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I have new TweetDeck. It looks the same as old TweetDeck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have just lost all credibility as a disaster manager. How could you possibly run out of wine??? disasterdiva<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Non-hockey fans, feel free to ignore the following ... OMG, they traded Iggy! And Morrow this week too. I guess maybe I'm a pens fan now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh, I dunno much about them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would just get a new Tivo! antennaGirl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that is what I miss most about Oregon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on service. DirecTV has Genie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even with marked cars out there, people loiter. Hate that about SeaTac.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now back to hockey. letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in the day, I was only one in center with net access cuz I had my own dial-up acct and knew how to use modem! oldschool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of that due to restrictions that are meant to prevent breaches though. We didn't have at OUR station, but was in room.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can you say upset? Love the playoffs! letsgobirds (@ Seattle Thunderbirds w/ 6 others)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We tend to see people in fear after a large event elsewhere. They come seeking information to alleviate their fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a fine balance, but I find they often seek info from a fear perspective. Want them to leave with less fear, more power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just learned that my fav researcher is now faculty at the same school I am. Exited for gender disaster research collaboration! EM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to capitalize on existing fear and turn it into empowerment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had 15 applicants for my open position. Only two of them met the clearly stated, bolded,mhighlighted in red, minimum requirements. *sigh*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Atriskpop great idea of the day: use handheld devices to make quick vids of emer msgs from native speakers, inc ASL. Put on web. Send link.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Atriskpop gap ID: svc providers want info via smem. Don't seem to know it's available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More atriskpop stats: svc providers rely heavily on email and broadcast media for emer info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More atriskpop stats: govt pushes emergency info via their own tv and radio stations. Virtually no svc providers get info from there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More atriskpop stats: govt pushes emergency info via websites, but low % of svc providers go look for it there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Information sharing exercise in atriskpop warning and notification track.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some stats I presented from atriskpop preconf survey. Govt pushes info via SMEm but svc providers don't look for it there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So would all the fine folks affiliated with _defcon_. disasterstudent<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Heh. Gotta love interpreting 140 characters sometimes. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm confused. How can CherylBle be your manager if you're in Spokane??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! couldhavebeenworse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too! I aim to be ready to respond to their fear with info that leaves them empowered and no longer fearful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whew! That senator is one of my CERT grads! Would hate to think we conveyed wrong message!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We just have to be ready to provide disaster prep info when they are motivated, regardless of reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My impression was that came from a speaker, not a senator. beprepared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are sometimes motivated to seek preparedness out of fear though. Tsunami was huge motivator.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>*snort*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I consider certs more of a "what can I do for others now" than "what can they do for me".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, not me. A colleague. It takes a lot to get me to visit the south! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Word of advice: never grow up. It's overrated. STEWest schuback TheFireTracker2 CharlieFrid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find that many wanting EM jobs don't actually understand what they are ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait what? You wrote a book?? Alisha_Beth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think I've been to GEMA ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You didn't hijack! The threads evolved. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm recerting my CEM this year. So I think the convo just came full circle ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woohoo! blues win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're not one of my students are you??? :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Academic affiliations are super handy! Gives access to all sorts of stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My aunt just got out of PH and went to the VA. Good move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the follow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That makes me sad. I figure at least 25 more years for me. Unless I win lottery, TheFireTracker2 schuback alisha_beth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember, you don't have to pay for the privilege of doing research unless you want the letters after your name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems to be a huge need for hosp EM. Multicare has had open position for months that they can't fill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There will be drinking involved once that can finally be said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm gonna finish my PhD, then goof off. Maybe flight school for fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the follow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yeah. Portlandia. I knew that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forget, where did you get yours? Alisha_Beth TheFireTracker2 nikibender<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to do the NPS exec leader thing, or whatever it's called. Not the degree though. Too much work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My degree is MPA with EM concentration, which was perfect for my job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've been saying we're "new" for 15 years. We need get over ourselves. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been pondering a year of tech school. Could immediately launch into lucrative IT disaster recovery, but would be bored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dye my hair to make that very point ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My hubby, the college drop out, makes twice what I do and I'm ABD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don't get a grad degree for the money. You get it because you love to learn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think if I started calling my syllabus the course FAQ students would actually read it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seem to have become my dad's own personal Snopes .... *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I expect a visit from IT shortly. That link got me a big warning from our Internet filter. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh the things the little darlings will eat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not terribly sad. I hated it on my Android. Like the newest one for PC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more thing I would have to learn. Which means I would have to forget how to do something else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you!! In shelter ops class. Bored!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except for the lactose intolerant or allergic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah coffee, elixir of life . . . And good grammar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe fined, not find??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel a little creeped out that the views are either anonymous or people I know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks LinkedIn for letting me know that my friends are stalking my profile. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to my world . . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yikes! What class are you in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, are you a Chicago fan Carol???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm neither a Red Wings or Blackhawks fan, but wht a hockey game!! nhl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wish I was there just to see this! MT JaneGambill Storm Trooper Beeker & Obi Wan the Eagle. ECCC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would probably get the half liter bottles and drink them in one sitting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to rescind my last comment. It turns out that some sodastreamusa flavors (the Natural ones), do not contain evil Splenda. win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was all excited to get a sodastreamusa machine, until I discovered all of their stuff is sweetened with evil splenda. So much for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You seem to give great advice. Maybe you SHOULD charge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's hard not to enjoy them all at once! yum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CERT TTT day 3. 31 new instructors about to hit the field. With Alisha_Beth TeamRubicon rentonem cert winning awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to have TeamRubicon members from teamrubicon_10 in my CERT TTT class this week. Great org, great mission. Plus long-lost co-worker!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing better than coming home after a long day and finding that you remembered to order Alki Bakery Mini Brownies from SmithBrosFarms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ask Alisha_Beth what she's doing! cert TTT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love CERT TTT class! cert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the follow! Do you know SamuelRipley? You strike me as kindred spirits ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh! Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My current position gave preferecnce for CEM. Have seen others that do too, but $$ isn't my primary motivation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just as with any accreditation process. only a barrier if you let it be. didn't find it hard or burdensome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you're all such good students!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing is local anymore! And you do some of the best whl coverage anywhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The replacement ref has arrived! TBirdsGameday winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the league game sheet we weren't even supposed to have Brooks. There has to be a great story here somewhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In ~20 years I've never been to a game with 2 linesman and no refs! They're gonna earn their pay tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forgot I cleaned stuff out of my parents place. Opened glovebox yesterday, full of goat pics!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So not changing my handle! I've been scba since before there was an @ option. It's my old irc nic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. Good point. Google Translate tells me the language is Filipino. Still annoying though, since devices chirp at my name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people who type in languages I can't read keep mentioning me in their tweets???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the question applies to all EM, not just hosp. Fussy resp have to quit being responders when they move to EM though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I were Carnival, I would not be happy with the nonstop coverage of doom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thing my office was empty for that one. I got the giggles! goattweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get him a pedicure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too little, too late. Started with poor coverage. Ended with incomptent customer service. After 10 years too. sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh-oh. my calendar says next week too. Gonna have to check now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New phone. Been shutting off audibles as they make themselves known to me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. What's Thursday??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, just while I was driving. Hard to resistant that urge for even 10 minutes though! *beep* "look at me".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eh, not really yet. Gonna be a while I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More like trying to squash the beeps. you know how the brain really needs to now what that beep was RIGHT NOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You two with your tweeting while I'm trying to get to work. *beep* "look at me", says my phone, every few seconds. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goodbye and good riddance TMobile. I thought we would part ways peacefully, but alas, your systems and processes dictated otherwise. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't DM you since you don't follow me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I have contacted support. Many times. Which is why I know they suck. I can PM you order .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure that's everybody's rule!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a test gone bad. And a rapid job opening. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think I've ever experienced worse customer service than groundctrl. 3 months since order, still no stuff (they have my $ tho).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to go to emeraldcitycon just to have my pic taken with wilw and feliciaday. Does life get any better than that??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What/where is Vine? I take it it's different from Microsoft's old Vine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No link yet I'm aware of. Only memo. Supposed to go live on USAJOBS tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching presentation on new SCADA system and all I can think about is last year's defcon session where they hacked one real time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public Works Committee Meeting. Also known as the day the engineers all wear ties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Based on own observations and info from students across the country, fairly common.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most cops around here DO carry a rifle in their patrol cars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now time for my much anticipated root beer float.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a bad link.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband said "I don't rly know many with a little farmer in them". I said "look around the room!". Dad was in the last in our fam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would say nearly extinct. None left in our family, just memories ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got the farmer covered too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a generator for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want the goat too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there you were!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember you'll have to wait an extra 35 minutes for them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was horrible!! crackinstyle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently, since nolaready is shouting it's not a terrorist attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparentlyn not enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it! Strong, powerful women. Showing the world that nobody can own them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I could have totally done without the closeup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn't horrified, just grossed out. godaddy sb47<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's already in my feed. Look for my last goatTweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're not watching, you missed the funniest goat commercial I've ever seen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I've ridden a goat before, and I've ran frantically after one, and been dragged by one, but never jogged.Or hiked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At SeattleTbirds game. Really annoying pdxwinterhawks fans behind us. In club seats no less. letsgobirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even my indoor kitties managed to snag birds thru their cat run outside. Found a headless one in the bedroom Friday ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heehee!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I guess my lies worked then?? Congrats. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now if we could get an NHL team, Seattle would be perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sort of amazed by the silence of wilw as his beloved Kings raise the banner ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, BIll Gates said he couldn't ever imagine people needing more computing power back in the 80s ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dense freezing fog even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All seriousness tho, msg prob needs to come from their respected peers. Trust already built.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There weren't a lot of EMs in times past. That too was a fad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're using some of the historical prooof. Many said Internet was a fad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's why I like historical. People felt that way about phones, radios, cells, Internet, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking that, but I was going to keep it to my inside voice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facts and case studies can't always overcome "that's the way we've always done it". I like to point out historical similarities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to answer the question of why first? If you can clearly ID why you're doing something, easier to answer how. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please quit tagging me in your tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Support said no way to look at log and know what the issue is. I suspect an illegal character or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already did both of those. The log is 100+ pages long and doesn't point to where the error is. Only what's about to change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they had betting logging, could prob id the troublemaker and remove one record, instead of this nonsense. But they don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's definately conflict resolution. But no way to know which record is issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They advertise that you're supposed to be able to do both, so it should not caused problems to use as advertised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both. I have contributors online, plus I use my iPad when I'm out and about. At home, I do data cleanup via PC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been working on issue for 2 months. Ancestry finally said my options were to lose data or spend hours (again). So hours it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have biz class internet service at home, so that's not an issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That isn't the issue. Fails during the sync process, trying to merge the online info. Have the change log, but won't process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both. The sync failed (again) and they can't fix anything. Have to unlink, redownload, and merge back. Will take many hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to love ancestrydotcom, but the software sucks. Only solution for my problem (again) is "lose data" or "spend hours merging". fail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wanna buy a 1937 pickup?? I've actually driven this one. Super cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm an OGT (original goat tweeter).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My goattweets are always legit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, CherylBle, in all seriousness, where's a good place to live within 20 miles of VAN that is goat friendly? Aunt moving there ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Link??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a horrific G2X that I would like to run over with a truck. The wi-fi calling disappeared in some upgrade or another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disappointed in ancestrydotcom's FTM software and customer service. When the "solution" involves losing data, it's time to move on. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which would be great if wifi calling worked on my phone, but it doesn't. I'm just roaming. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out that TMobile has no data coverage in the "middle of nowhere" Kansas. Thankfully the relatives have wifi. Oddly, so does Sam's!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big kudos to petmateproducts for refunding my $$ when my cat water dish failed. Love a company that stands behind their products!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the most frustrating things about teaching college: Students still don't put their names on their papers!! Fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got stuck in San Diego for 9 hours on way from from IAEM due to mech issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did have a good time! Sorry I missed you too. Couldn't spare the morning though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in case anybody was wondering, it's about 80 degrees with a light breeze and sun here in HNL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My only regret is that I didn't get the wheel package. That bugger is heavy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get one of the Honda inverter generators. Creates electronics-friendly power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should be on the website. If not, use the info address. I'm on vaca, so no easy access!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did, but it was for IAEM12 with somebody else's camera. Try Beth or Karen. They should have it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a Hawaii GoatTweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I were on the SMEM panel. She kicked it off! I pontificated about higher ed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanted the NEMA data on SMEM that was presented at the Seattle conference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got some connections there, so maybe I'll eventually get my hands on it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad day. NEMA won't release that data to me. Only "to the states", whatever that means. Thanks for the info though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better question: Firefox, why do you crash everytime I use Google maps?? Chrome doesn't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks! (from a JSU grad and PT faculty member).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I couldn't find the original publication date on that paper. Can you let me know what it is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, the tech came, but with insufficient parts. Still missing a foot. I'm done with this nonsense though. Gonna glue one on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whew!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. From a 9 hour mechanical delay that was their fault. That outage was a comm issue they had no control over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why AlaskaAir rocks. Personal apology for massive flight delay, plus 12,500 bonus miles. Happy customer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New Attorney General in WA gets honor of taking on the feds in a state's rights battle over marijuana. Should be interesting! election2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brian Williams is getting a little goofy. I think he needs a nap. nbcpolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now time for campaign reform. $6 BILLION is far too much to have spent on elections. I can think of far better uses. election2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a great night for women, in many, many ways. election2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing that makes me sad about election2012 is the amount of money spent on ads. Think what good we could do with those billions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>22 minutes until WA polls close. So much to watch! election2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. 87% voter turnout in King County. Amazing! election2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new election night prodcure: Watch Brian Williams on nbcpolitics and read tweets from wilw. Awesomeness abounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brian Williams quote of the night "There's a whole lot of weed on the ballot tonight". nbcpolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it appears that somebody locally here has parts for me, but again, they called the wrong number. So another delay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I followed you yesterday. And shipping the part while I'm on vacation isn't going to help. And my phone call never came.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you DM me the contact info? I want to ask nicely for the report so I can base my PhD on it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have the raw SMEM data from NEMA? Can I have a copy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the world of goattweets. They make us all *squee*. We have our own little subculture of cuteness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lest you think I only tweet my unhappiness with Dell, I also post GoatTweets becuase they make me smile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It didn't go anywhere. I did a live chat and they promised me a phone call at my desk btw 1-5. No all came. I'm out 'til Thurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, so, this was a massive fail. Your tech called my house, where I wasn't for a week, then cancelled my service call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to offer up resources for an EMAC request for the first time. Paperwork is done. Waiting has commenced. Interesting process. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your critical BIOS update fried the computer. It's getting a new motherboard on Tuesday. Way to go ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, dellcares, your critical bios update for our $4000 AlienWare laptop just turned it into a brick. Nice job ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally in the air and on my way home! What a day. I love tweeting from 30,000 feet to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously AlaskaAir I love you, but after my 9 hour wait, I couldn't board because my rez was cancelled. Fixed by gate agent but what a day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to BrianDoran5 for landing a much coveted F5networks internship. Rock it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did not expect to be sitting in the San Diego airport working on sandy support, yet here I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to go find power. All the seats with outlets re currently occupied by people who aren't using them. longday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally power cycled e iPad and that at least forced it to quit trying. Now I can tweet again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sooooo tired. By the time I get home from IAEM12, I will have been up for 23 hours. This was not in the plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the obvious answer, but I can't get it to delete either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. Alaska is my fav. I have MVP status.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a really stupid question for the nerdherd. My ipad got stuck updating apps and now I can't use those apps. How do I fix? smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just FYI, an $8 food voucher for a 9 hour delay is not really sufficient. We've sat here through lunch and dinner . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're flying a new part for our plane in from either SEA or LAX. They're not sure which. But they're bringing snacks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, no update. I can hear them on the radio, trying to find the mechanic to give an update. Computer glitch on the plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gate agents are busy rebooking. Only people with mobile access have heard the new projected time. Kind of a goat rope in SAN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made it to SAN an hour early, but now we've been hit with a 2 hour delay to SEA. Apparently alaskaair is having a bad day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you so much for the link to EPIC. Reading from 30,000 feet now. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello from 30,000 feet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would love to, but flight doesn't get in til 1400 local time. SMEMChat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any chance you can DM me that full citation? Sounds like something to build on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reno. Then San Antonio in 2014.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It does however point to the need for official sources to get on the situations quickly, becuase ppl make stuff up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I think it's pretty safe to say that more bad info goes over SM simply becuase it's quick and easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm. Interesting and relevant. Wonder how that would be researched and vetted. Pondering ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you people airborne finally??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't figure out exactly what this convo is about, but I'm a grad student who just got ok to study SMEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this nerd is off to bed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were all over it! Already fixed. Just waiting for DNS to propagate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, us nerds have geek things to do tonight. I had to get a misdirected domain pointed in the right direction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Iaem12 was awesome, but I could have done without the 0030 push via the app, inviting me to next year's conference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope it works out for you and the people you are trying to help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three stages of disaster: denial, deliberation, decision. People might get stuck in the first two. Those people might die. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. Just ends up costing everybody more. Like the "food drive" in Ohio yesterday . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My work email sent me the "your mailbox is almost full" MSG yesterday. Had to remote in and delete . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They also notice one person needing "stuff" and ignore the 500 saying "send cash".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are useless, except as local food bank donation. Disasters need cash to agencies, not random stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So don't give it to the Red Cross. There are many agencies you can partner with who have est delivery routes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agencies can stretch your dollars and they have established delivery routes/methods and will be allowed in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know people want to help, but the very best thing to do is donate cash to established relief agencies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to my colleague Dr. Jane Kushma on winning the IAEM Academic Recognition award. IAEM12 cc: JSUNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>IAEM12 mobile app wonkiness. Different versions in circulation, with different times. My iPad says one thing, my droid something else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If any of the WA peeps at IAEM12 run into Phyllis Mann, let her know she won a cool award!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will be back in SEA Friday afternoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, my fine SMEM peeps, I just got official approval to change my PhD dissertation to an SMEM topic. Bring it! IAEMemt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I almost snorted water out my nose at that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mini rant: Reporter just said someplace has to rebuild the road every year due to storm damage. Maybe it's time to move the damned road!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I put in the official request today to change my PhD dissertation topic to SMEM. Maybe I can work that in ..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're not in the impact area, the best way to help with sandy is to donate money to legit relief organizations. Not stuff, money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For some reason, my devices failed to show me your tweet until I got back to my room. Oh well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Alisha_Beth, I want to join the ETC. IAEM12 iaemtech IAEMETC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, not at all. Just need force multiplier to handle volume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One I'm following on FB and they are slammed. Can't keep up (think it's just one person) smem vost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just talking about offering remote help to some. They get same questions over and over. Remote ppl could answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brought in people to supplement existing skill set (same thing going on now).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe not. I've accepted help mid-stream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure, except to identify them and offer help. Might be hard for them to verify credibility. vost smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching small jurisdictions in sandy area trying desperately to keep up with sm and losing the battle. Probably don't know about smem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is super awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stated on their feed that it was taken by one of their employees at the Delta gate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bought your book! I expect an autograph. :) thinking about using it for my undergrad Public Info course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sagarin's talk is making me want to redo my course syllabi into something more uniquely adaptable. Wonder if it work online? IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sagarin: issue your challenge broadly and engage people you wouldn't normally connect with. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sagarin: stop giving orders and start issues challenges. Makes people more adaptable. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sagarin: how do we start becoming adaptable again? IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nature makes systems that work well. We tend to mess them up. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better to learn from your success instead of your failures. This is how nature thrives. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do it too! Just don't normally tweet on people I know! IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Symbiotic partnerships are critical in nature and applicable to human systems. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny to see her referred to as Griswold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nature uses redundancy and decentralization to deal with problems. We can too! IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We want to be adaptable, but we don't know how. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fascinating perspective on what we can learn from nature that can be applied to EM. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not your aunt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmmm. This morning I was following more than 400 people and more than 400 were following me. Now twitter says ~350 each. strange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hearing a lot about leaving your comfort zone at IAEM12. Seems to be a trend across sessions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I've been told!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannot. The family is working the resources available, but haven't located her yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leadership Symposium day 2. Speaker Rafe Sagarin. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scarcity increases desirability. How to translate to preparedness? IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes he has. I think it's available out at the bookstore. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long story. But no, appears it was down when she tried. So she called relatives. Thanks for local shelter #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody have contact with responders in BrickTownship NJ? I'm aware of insulin dependent person trapped by flood water. sandy smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my part of the country, we use "shelter in place" for any event that requires you to stay put.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Learned a new acronym today: MSU. It might not mean what you think! Thanks Leadership Symposium! IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for the first session of the pilot IAEM Leadership Symposium. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! Thank you for monitoring and being responsive. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People don't resist change, they resist being changed. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been going on in all the big rooms all day. Building design flaw! IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is an awesome and funny speaker! And she doesn't mind that we finished our desert while she talks. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a pre-req!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm hoping that since it's only three days and I'm really just tweeting, I will be ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>250 meg, $14.99/mo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just switched to 3G off of wifi. Working much better. IAEMtech IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, just forked over my credit card. Seems much better than the wifi!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. USCG used 3 million miles of containment boom during Deepwater Horizon. That's a lot of boom! IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it working pretty well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>USCG speaker talking about this morning's sandy activities as part of iaem12 update. Nearly real time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IAEM12 iaemtech anybody using ATT data at the conf? Thinking about buying for the week if it's better than the free wi-fi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get what it is, but need tech that adapts to behavior, not try to make behavior conform to tech. Losing battle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently by skipping the debates, I missed the fact the Romney has said he will cut FEMA. Scary proposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someday I will quit being cheap and pay for my own connection!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems counterintuitive to tell people in crisis to read a website about how to tweet. Proper tweets??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Free wi-fi is getting saturated. Sad day, IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strange tech issues in main conference room today. I think somebody keeps leaning on the light switch! IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They said by the end of the year. IAEM12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually use TweetCaster. Like it pretty well. Just had to figure out the list feature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was replaced at iaem12 by a preview of the new website. Not exactly a fair trade, but exciting none the less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah for new iaem website! iaem12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So cool that IAEM is truly international now, with solid representation from around the world. iaem12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I figured it out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just followed everybody in the iaem12 stream, but can't figure out how to make lists in the twitter client. Hmmmmm . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's pretty common for all big venues. Hotel staff can better direct first responders since they know where we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. Major hotel tech failure at IAEM12. Sound system fubar. Or they're rebroadcasting sandy wind sounds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: venti, non-fat plain latte. Her: we don't have plain. Me: that means with no flavor starbucks fail IAEM12 NotInSeattleAnymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In our neck of the woods we tell them we're not coming for them if they refuse to evac. And we mean it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canceling some things to make bed space for FEMA Corps. Planning for days with no power on campus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting to hear first hand what EMI is doing due to sandy. iaem12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for Training and Education Committee meeting! iaem12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And tsunami ADVISORY now extended to all BC coast, to Washington border. Nothing for WA at this time. bcquake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to bed. Of course phone is going to make "that noise" everytime the State Duty Officer updates us with "nothing to see here, move along"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, they do put those pesky K and L keys right next to each other!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've exercised that in Seattle, using the Seattle fault scenario. Would be devestating locally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I'm wide awake now. And still hungry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WCATWC Bulletin 4: Tsunami recorded with small amplitutes in SE AK. Forecast for S Cental AK below 30 cm. Same warnings in effect. bcquake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband's company sells the product to make it happen, but I won't go there either ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their e-mail and teletype products are working, but website can't handle the surge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those websites may be down, however the network and the WCATWC are both operating at capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't to me, since most websites don't have surge capacity. They could, but won't spend the $$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It appears that Tofino made a local decision to evac, not based on official warnings. Interesting indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best reason ever to sign-up for their email products, which arrive almost immediately. No web needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I stuck with Gatorade and saltines ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tofino has activated Tsunami warning system and is evacuating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope there wasn't ice cream in there, melting away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should go to bed, but waiting on reports out of BC,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The trusted source is WCATWC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Google map somebody showed was valid data, just not limited to actual warning area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to do that at IAEM last year due to food poisoning. Wasn't pretty ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See you here! Bring food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. Just pointing out we should hear something any moment ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was three minutes ago ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do have staff 5 floors down. They might quit being my staff if I wake them up for a food run though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tsunami confirmed by WCATWC via deep ocean pressure sensor. Warning area same as before. bcquake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've already switched to jammies mode however.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you look at readings, the fault is rumbling N to S. 7.7 was 139 km s, 5.8 was 154 km S, and 4.8 was 202 km S (of Masset). bcquake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would you quit talking about food??? I'm stuck in a hotel room with only fruits and veggies and I want something more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that they're responding means they're still there! Good sign ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has some data associated with and says where it came from:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm thinking maybe due to remoteness of area. had same observation though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Figures. Now I'm hungry and it's almost midnight local time ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmmm. Love me some Tim Hortons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't tried the link, so not sure it if works (or if I typed it correctly!).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good assumption. I got first alert at 2309 EDT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I assumed it was a Juan de Fuca. Which could be a good thing. They've had a swarm up there of late. Pressure relief ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just had to go there ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's part of the reason we have an IAEM Theory to Practice subcommmitee in T&E. To bridge the gap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep things to a duller roar then, would you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief. Hurricane on the east coast, earthquake and tsunami warning for west coast. EMs all at iaem12.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So jealous! I signed up and paid my money, but apparently was not quick enough. At least I'm getting my money back. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Smemforum participants: ask your non-Tweeting neighbor if they want help setting up account. Did at wsema and got new person tweeting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Difficult to exercise sm due to risk of public misunderstanding. Solution: non public accounts just for exercise and training. smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that basic PIO curriculum hasn't really caught up with sm. smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! Look at all those new followers I picked up today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now up: Mark Clemens from waEMD to talk about online training for PIOs. smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final thought. We live in an info commodity market. If you're not part of it, you lose credibility. smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Takeaway: consolidated information sharing in geographic areas is a huge service to the public. smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only in an smemforum does someone describe a website in terms of ICS forms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take a leap and go for it when somebody presents you with a new idea. smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unified command established ahead of time can eliminate interjurisdictional squabbles. smemforum<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Next up: me! smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but you can be on the Net without having high speed in your home. Public access for instance. SMEMForum NEMA12<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, I do chair the IAEM Theory to Practice subcommittee. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. Japan had use of internet via cellphone even after SMS had died. smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's arguably better than "Dancing with Goats" though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Concept: using non-deployed USAR members to be the sm eyes and ears for the deployed members. smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking that was a great number!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Communities are using sm to organize themselves in disaster. smemforum<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Eep! Send me your notes or thoughts and I will share them with mine. NEMA12 smemforum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So cruel ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is me ignoring your taunting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously people. Coordinate your photos of the menu. Now I'm hungry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goats too?? Must be quite the shindig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what? I'm missing out on nerding out??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited to meet all the cool kids IRL at smemforum tomorrow. Like meeting the irc peeps in the old days! youngatheart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will be presenting at the NEMA meeting in Seattle tomorrow with my JSU "hat" on. Follow the live tweets at SMEMForum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EMD will come do a PA training just for your agency if you want them to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attend the PA workshop! Best source of info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all "unofficial" or "draft" at this point. Tell people to attend the EMD PDA workshops though. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We barely touched on that. The changes to process are a killer. Single Cat A and Cat B PW per jurisdiction is one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait til you get your annual PA brief from EMD. Some of it is done deal. Harder for us on several fronts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking just the opposite! demotivated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And today we are learning the FEMA HQ PA program has lost it's !&*% mind. redtape fema crazytalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrible. Interestingly enough, we were just talking about this sort of thing at work this afternoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to our world of goattweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someday I'll have to tell you the story of my goat on the roof of my dad's car, sunning herself ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet there are more cats ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle is just preparing for your arrival!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That reminds me that I should probably finish putting my presentation thoughts in order ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay for goat tweets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doh! Forgot about smemchat today. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You too! And no problem. We all have to play to our strengths! Mine is creating order out of chaos. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless you have way more power than most EMs I know, not your fault. Though if you do have that power .. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad day. Spokane airport not setup for electronic boarding passes. Luckily secuirty line was also short since I had to go thru twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Large high profile incidents will involve more jurisdictions and responders than you can fathom. Hard to manage. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be positive about outcomes until you know w/certainty that outcome is not positive. Keeps internal morale and productivity up. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be very clear internally on who can release information and what they can release. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Number of false tips and claims in Klaas case tied up a lot of resources. unfortunate reality of big cases. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your experience is a great asset in response. It can also work against you if you get stuck in your box. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaker is Ed Fryer, the lead investigator from the Polly Klaas case. Changed his life. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emergency management should be a key player in child abduction response. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Volunteers are going to come out of the woodwork in a child abduction case. Have a plan to use them instead of turning away. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to hear CERT mentioned so many times as a resource for child abduction support. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 49% of child abduction cases, the child is murdered in the first hour. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Child abduction is a primary law enforcement response, but requires huge support network from all disciplines. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And WAStateEMA is the wsema website down or is it just me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Child Abduction Response Team (CART) is like an IMT for child abduction cases. Asset I did not know we had in WA. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Child abduction stats are terrifying. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting in wsema session, listening to tsunamisteph, emailing with woods_jared on a project for CherylBle. Multi tasking is good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! Spent almost $1 million on literature review of existing Cascadia research, papers, and documents. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The twitters seem to have eaten my photo post of tsunamisteph's awesome "success" diagram. Sad. :( wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that he just said Eastern WA will become a camp for responders in Cascadia quake. Probably not much of an exaggeration! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Issue I hadn't thought of: significant Columbia River pollution in event of big Cascadia quake. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Planning for an event that will likely happen only once in 5-6 generations is complicated and needs realistic approach. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we plan for what may happen as though it will!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday Nemo, today zombies! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vertical evacuation is the latest and greatest in tsunami evac, but complicated and expensive. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pacific County is the foggiest place on earth. whoknew wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to tsunamisteph talk about tsunami planning scares me. Hope there's never one while we're on family clamming expeditions. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eastern WA will be without power for 2-4 days in the event of a catastrophic Cascadia subduction zone quake. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, wsema day 3. Love seeing everybody, but love going home too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember that in order to get extra credit for PST314, your posts must be directly related to WMD current events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes. Somebody took one for the team. Tiny entertainment mishap, but everybody is ok. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take politics and beauracracy out of the equation and focus on serving the public. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't just use tech to use it. Make it an extension of your mission. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love wsema! on one side of room posting about real time "no tsunami" , other side about bus accident. Nobody knows we're out of town!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could listen to Alisha_Beth and schuback for much longer, but alas, they are between us and dinner! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, there's an app for that. WA 211 wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be cognizant of households that don't have Internet. Many use Internet, just not at home. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Development of tech tools should reflect your core values. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WA is one of the biggest technology states in the country. We need to connect with that and leverage it. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to start thinking about how we can share technology instead of putting it in silos. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just took us to Mr. Rogers neighborhood to envision shared damage assessment apps. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get everybody in the room to decide requirements before you embark on development. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You owe the acronym fine box a whole buck for that one! wsema finebox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be willing to accept what the community already uses, even if it's not exactly what you would design. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pinterest and Instagram are viable EM tools. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Figure out what problem you're actually trying to solve and don't replace it with a new one. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always have an urge to torment my friends when they speak! schuback and Alisha_Beth are up next. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm all over it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daily goattweet for CherylBle and mdeyerin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But he looked at me like I'd grown a third eye when I said it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems to be overlooking how it works locally though. We don't have local VOAD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You cannot do the same things and expect new results. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things you learn at wsema: Boy Scout Eagle award is one shot project. Girl Scout Gold award requires sustainable project.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know! Going on the Disneyworld EOC tour. Should be awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Disney even more today. Great ideas for engaging kids and families. And their customer service ethic runs thru entire org. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daily rant: in one of the richest countries in the world, we should not have any homeless kids, let alone 22,000 just in WA. Fixitnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extreme rock, paper, scissors: Drop beats Cover, Cover beats Hold, Hold beats Drop. Thanks Disney! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kids aren't interested in coloring sheet once they enter school. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More in common! Though I was search and rescue, then police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teach kids English, but don't let them die in a quake because they haven't learned it yet and can't read the Drop, Cover, Hold sign. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, WAStateEMA, if I fill out my conference eval online, what do I bring to dinner tonight? wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I believe it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stats on homeless kids and kids in poverty are staggering. And heartbreaking. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great info on how to get prep projects in big orgs, like the Girl Scouts. Oddly enough, I was a Boy Scout, through Exploring. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think this is what they meant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Engage families by engaging the kidsM wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And just like that, I'm going to chair an ad hoc committee on Constitution and Bylaws changes for WAStateEMA! ordertochaos wsema loveit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More members equals more interest! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it normal to let non-members speak to issues that are being voted on! They can't vote, so why do they get to speak?? wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dangerous to refer to resiliency as a "syndrome" when it is the core of disaster recovery. em<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of candidates from the floor for wsema offices. Now time for candidate statements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard interesting comment from Fed at wsema. Said he didn't vote because this wasn't his organization.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wsema membership report: we have 247 members, up more than 60 from last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, CherylBle are you the Legislative Committee chair for wsema next year? If so, sign me up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to miss CherylBle as wsema president. Good luck Jim Hall!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eggs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make your COOP plans short and keep copies in multiple accessible places. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There isn't really a requirement to do it. There is no law that says we must. We have to do CEMP, but not COOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which of you is frick and which of you is frack??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COOP planning should be specific and usable. The people who are going to use it should write it too. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lesson learned: COOP can be fun for employees. Give out prizes for participation. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wireless was far less saturated yesterday. Been kinda ick today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Port of Seattle COOP affects the entire region. Much of our stuff comes brought their facilities. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Decentralized COOP planning. That sounds like the exact thing I wan to do locally. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoot! Alisha_Beth is going to speak now! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talking about goat herd in WA with Q Fever. Official EM goattweet wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course we've heard of Q Fever. We're emergency managers. We know about all the wired ?^%! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agriculture requires a huge public private partnership. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think it's luck so much as proper handling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I'm learning things at wsema from people who aren't even here. Love sm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of fear over non pasteurized milk. I grew up on it and seem to be fine . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please put a quarter in the acronym fine box!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! Ferrets are big carriers of human transmitable flu virus. whoknew wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of info on how viruses evolve and jump from animals to humans. Lots of big words and cool pics! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good news: foot and mouth disease is not zoonotic, meaning people can't catch it. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Foot and mouth disease is very scary and poses a huge threat. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ag is bigger in our state than most people realize. Protecting it is critical. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mini work crisis resolved. Back to wsema tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought for the day: Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part. Except when it does . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It depends. Neutral winters often bring huge wind and rain storms to Puget Sound.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally different part of the state, but they are happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh that's not good. Weather Service says we might end up with a neutral winter. Get out the hip waders. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This morning brings us "Weather with Ted and Andy". Always entertaining! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh, the Type 1 Nerd Herd returns!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's never to late!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have my ICS 100 curriculum with me. I can do a quick refresher if needed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grrrrr. 2 days notice to complete an urgent task and I'm out of the office. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's go shopping!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect afternoon speaker. Unplanned humor and keeping everyone's attention. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah! Maps embedded with nano dots. And a special pen that reads them. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GIS had to be stupid simple. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She didn't elaborate, but I will find out. JSU's started last year, mostly distance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crerar: working on EM Bachelors degree program in WA to compliment existing AA and Masters degree. Need to offer all 3 in state. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crerar: 2 new PhD programs in emergency management starting in the country right now. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crerar: emergency management is a rapidly professionalizing career field. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cookie break! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Badger: this is what Whole Community means: community members helping community members in a disaster. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seymour: 2nd objective of FAST is to educate those with functional needs that they CAN and WILL be accommodated in shelter. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seymour: FAST teams integrate with local shelter teams to provide seamless service for shelter clients. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FAST is designed to keep as many people as possible in general population shelters, as opposed to medical needs shelters. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seymour: those with functional needs are usually the best people to tell you what they need in terms of accommodation. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now up: Sheri Badger and Christine Seymour speaking about Functional Assessment Service Team (FAST). wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spokane seems to be allergy central. Sneezing. Itching eyes. Blech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tuned out when speaker said women are second rate citizens. Wasn't really his message, but I just tuned out. Other option is anger . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wallace: need to take care of basic needs before people can move forward. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wallace is advocating for change over resiliency. Seems to have a limited view of community resiliency. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wallace: we need to change the way we do things if we want different results. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next up: Chuck Wallace from Grays Harbor County. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's getting a little chilly in the wsema conference room. Or I just need a nap!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! You nerd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's cool. Red Cross Seattle provides prep classes for all Habitat for Humanity home owners. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fortman: way to get to the parents is through their kids. Make kid projects that require parent help. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fortman: make preparedness cool. Recycling caught on. Preparedness can too! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fortman: basing new prep campaign on best practices from around the country. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fortman: great research on community preparedness in Western WA. Starting new preparedness campaign. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now up: Emily Fortman from American Red Cross. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daughtery: high priority to get tsunami shelters on WA coast. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daugherty just showed he's one of the gang. Tech fail. Appropriate level of sarcasm. :) wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clear message from WA Military department. They are very busy and have very diverse missions. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daugherty: don't want to fight over pie. Wants to bring more pie to the table. Quote of the day! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now up: the new Adjutant General of WA, MG Bret Daugherty. Took over 7/28, 2 disasters under his belt already. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny you mention that. Somebody in the room was complaining about that. How hard is it keep track of your passwords?? I keep all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conferences depress me, as I realize the huge list of things I should be doing but can't due to staff and budget constraints. *sigh* wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did start it before I left, but ran out of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Er, reminds me that my NIMSCAST report is due this week. Hotel room project I guess! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this reminds me that my NIMsCAST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We seriously need to implement an acrynom fine box for wsema!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meldrum: transpo MOUs can be used for evac or for getting your employees to work. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meldrum: setting expectations is critical to planning. Clear up bad assumptions before they bite you. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lokey: make sure your attorneys assist in creating MOUs and that they leave you eligible for FEMA reimbursement. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lokey: private sector must be linked in to planning. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lokey: after action from Katrina had same issues as AAR for Mt. St. Helen's. Same mistakes repeated. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lokey: in Katrina, people refused to get on trains because they didn't know where they were going. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lokey: trans/evac issues inc bad coord, focus on majority, reliance on cars, not enough use of multi modal trans, basic human nature. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sort of a poor private sector turnout at wsema. Maybe we can get a better turnout next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next up: Lokey and Meldrum on Access and Functional needs. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wsema exercising flexibility is key! We are ahead of schedule!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sheriff Ozzie: Spokane County very concerned about fire danger. Impacts entire state and beyond. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mullen: EMPG is a success because we are able to clearly articulate our accomplishments to Congress. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mullen: citizen expectations of EM are high, but resources have dwindled. Citizens must be partners and be prepared. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mullen: new statewide mutual aid is due to efforts of local EMs, not the State. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mullen: USGS is actively researching earthquake faults in Central and Eastern Washington. scary wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mullen: history shows that new governors will face a disaster or major emergency within 100 days of taking office. WSEMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mullen: confident that EM will remain high priority for new governor. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mullen: State is learning about EOC stress in real time due to large number of recent activations. wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's WSEMA silly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love when a conference starts with Drop, Cover, Hold quiz! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello Spokane. Hello wsema.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will be there too! wsema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just opened our vinyl of AFTW. Most awesome vinyl I've ever seen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crap. That's my husband's alma mater. He just signed and decreed that's not all that uncommon for there ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've made a pledge to save for college with Upromise by Sallie Mae!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buy make sure if you do that you don't use any sort of lock on you phone, as nobody will be able to access it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many police departments have secure drop drop boxes now too. They send them to the incinerator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, e-mail is best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed too close to home! Have friends on both campuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a fascinating argument with our new Comcast rep. Me explaining that if a phone req a modem, it wasn't POTS. Him sure it was. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dunno. I could go find out, but my multi-tasking is not so hot today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And just like that, smemchat dies for the day ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like $$$$. We call ours the "Senior Center". :) smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Renton does that. Put in locked info boards at various places in town. Vols trudge out post official notes. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10) web page 11) EAS 12-15) drawing a blank .... smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had surgery Wed. All left me alone. :) smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) reverse dial. 2) e-mail 3) text message 4) city TV 5) City Radio 6) flashing signs 7) Twitter 8) Facebook 9) door knocking 10) smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this a test for my day off?? I will try ....#smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've id'd "rumor centers" for ELL pops. Best way to get messages out for English-learning pops. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Redundancy is critical. We counted 15 ways we can deliver messages in our city, from SM to door knocking. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude. PINE rocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were camping in high-fire threat area. Only way to build redundancy there: make friends w/ neighbors w/Verizon. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The usual caution though applies for those who don't have SM access. Found myself unconnected recently due to coverage issues. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On donations issue, spotted on on SM related to Taylor Bridge. Directed focus on $$ instead of stuff. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's my day off. I always feel better on my day off! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SM gives cred to warnings since people can check with their friends and find they got the same thing. Basic brain function. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Checking in for smemchat for the first time in weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Chase Community Giving time. Go vote for the Auburn Food Bank, one of my favorite charities:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bummed that Seesmic has been acquired by Hootsuite. Loved Seesmic for my Android phone. Hated Hootsuite. Any smem recs for alt client?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I covet both your goats and your chickens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure Anne loves that garage cleaning was interrupted by Ebaying and Tweeting ... :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finally watched the Mercy video. Awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Edi, this does not count for extra credit as you did not actually post anything. You need a link to an article, plus a comment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad day. Somebody hit one of my backyard brush bunnies right in front of my driveway. :~(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, yes, but goats are cuter, sweeter, and in general have better personalities. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you kidding me?? The DNC took over your hashtag without checking first?? That's government for you!: P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tech and non-tech volunteers needed for seattlegivecamp on Oct 19-21.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in case anybody was feeling groggy today, they decided to test the fire alarms. We're awake, we're awake already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defeats the purpose to recruit vols you can't support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't recruit long-term vols if I can't communicate with them by myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That depends on the type of volunteers you are looking for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for posting Christine! pst314<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>View from our Terrace campsite at the Gorge. Love DMB weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gorge camping the weekend was really just a test to see how strong your tent poles were and how well you staked things. WINDY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does checking in with myself get me credit for Task 1?? 30days30ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's camping wine: 2003 Kestrel Old Vine Cab. Yum! thegoodlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much love for the acoustic violin. You rocked it tonite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new camping chair has a built in bottle opener. This is an exciting discovery! thegoodlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting at campsite, watching boats on river and the Gorge come to life. Waiting for bt_dmb, slessard, and the rest of dmb. thegoodlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're right! I forgot about that. GoatInfluence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'll leave that off my NEMA bio . . . GoatTweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On our way to see DMB at the Gorge. Can't wait to see bt_dmb, SLessard, and the rest of the gang bring it this weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Say it along with me everybody: Ticketmaster SUCKS! Leave it to them to screw up the only thing they're supposed to be good at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so looking forward to the Gorge this weekend! Hope you all are too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. ticketmaster fail. Their system is broken so I can't print my tickets Their solution? Charge me more and make me pick them up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would be all for it, but only if it can also find missing socks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are you helping with in Tampa? My sis lives there ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to drive one of these:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got the shipping notice for our DMB tickets today. Only 2 more weeks until the Gorge. Hurrah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Score one for the TSA. Not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can be a huge help in earthquakes too! Not their primary mission, but skills are valid for all-hazards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Skywarn does a lot of damage reporting where it's active. Helps pinpoint areas that need assistance. At least that's my view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel sort of, um, uncomfortable after reading that! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you to the komonews team for sharing with us all today. You're all handling it with such grace. kathi would be pleased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That story really needed a photo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We loved our Legos. My dad hated them. Something about bare feet, dark rooms, small parts ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will keep the cat lovers busy:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the bravest women in the world:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I need to change my job title to "Completer of Reports".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would sort of put a damper on hacker jeapordy though! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your daily GoatTweet CherylBle and MDeyerin:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have something really cool for you to solder next time I see you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's in January, but well, that might be ok afterall! Plus it's free for public employees to attend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So jealous! I miss them so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice post. And things were indeed obnoxious. Only fix is for more women to attend and point out bad behavio when it happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I got an email in my box this morning about an EM conference in NOLA. Hmmmm . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And woods_jared, apprently, thanks to CherylBle, we need to talk! DM me your email? Should be fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it was awesome! Can't wait to collaborate on something cool. smem DEFCON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vegas TSA: what is with all you defcon people and opting out? Privacy, lack of data, don't try to argue with me . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okie dokie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another thing you'll only see at defcon. Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, poplifegirl, DM me if you're still at defcon. Would love to meet you IRL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Crystal Method pretty well rocked my world at the defcon White Ball tonight. Damn my feet hurt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. I thought you were responding to a different tweet. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Google the phone number and it becomes more amusing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is where my worlds converge. Public agencies put very revealing info on FCC licenses. Searchable. Leaves CIKR vulnerable. defcon em<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things you only see at defcon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talk by Richard Thieme was just as fascinating as his keynote at defcon 4. FeelingOld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw a real bonafide man of the cloth at defcon. With a press pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should totally be at hacker karaoke defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huge advantage of being a girl at defcon: no bathroom lines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NSA has a recruiting site just for defcon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The goon squad is a little more on edge this morning with General Alexander from the NSA on deck. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude in the suit in front of me looks a little out of place.. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TommyDCat regales the defcon hacker karaoke crowd with Sweet Caroline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hacker karaoke. Oh yeah. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at the Rio for defcon too! Well, I'm staying close-by at any rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is in the vicinity of me this week, but I have not seen her . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The AC in our room is fail. 80 degrees in here, up from 78 this morning. They were supposed to fix. Not good in Vegas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did a great defcon 101 talk. Now great lockpicking 101 set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is pretty bad. I knew it would be here, but some has even surprised me. And they wonder why so few women at defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next year dude!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defcon: the only conference where they have to remind the attendees to shower . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got hit last week. I'm thinking sketchy third party app. De-authed almost everything and. Changed passwords.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is officially too much to do at defcon. overload<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Use the report spam button<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heels are the devil . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10:30 PM. 100 degrees. Slurpee Vegas DefCon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vegas, we are in you. Let the games begin. defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SEA to LAS defcon here we come!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, spellcheck. Once had a WMD student write a paper about salmonella, except spellcheck replaced it with semolina.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about schuback and caroldn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>24 hours until our arrival in Vegas for defcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go follow UtahGoatMan. Amusing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better than being dependent upon composting tweets ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that my feed is now full of GoatTweets thanks to UtahGoatMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP JP Patches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boeing is hiring an EM position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome! GoatTweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Password changed. Many apps access revoked. Hopefully problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did, I did, I did just send spam. Apologies! Password changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I just send spam???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call for Presentations: 2013 Partners in Emergency Preparedness Conference. Get yours in soon! piepc em smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's interesting to watch their posturing and excuses in the aftermath though. There's a lesson there somewhere ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just me and a contract employee. Have to rely upon volunteers for the rest!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard part is doing it during work. I can only do on days off. Work too busy for smemchat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter is taxing my brain this morning. So many columns, so much scrolling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A8: our official account actually says (WA) in the name, just to differentiate us from all the other Auburns. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those loops happen in regular comms too. Happened in our last exercise in a funny way. Like old telephons game! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same here! Limited personal capacity! Need vost for it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A8: I think it's critical that locations be clear, especially early. Even adding a (XX) with the state abbreviation would help. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other thing that bugs me is multiple incidents in similar sounding places, that are actually far apart. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: we don't really do SMEM off hours. I suppose we would if big enough incident and somebody thought to wake up the SMEM people. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Checking in to smemchat from stormy Seattle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's really cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a lightning injury east of Tacoma too. Not a direct hit luckily. Guy is going to be ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some really fantastic thunder here a little south of Seattle. And a bit of urban street flooding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay. I get to do smemchat this week! Might be hard with cats cowering around me, scared of thunder though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's supposed to taper off. I'm hoping before 11 so the tree service can do their job in my yard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fabulous thunder and lightning this morning. So much for sleeping in though! seattle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this happened today:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the casualties of last week's arson fire was CIS of Auburn. They lost all their stored items. Help if you can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has two EM openings. They're not tweeting them, so I will! One smem job (ESF 15 coord). Other is PA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have such a strage mix of followers on Twittern now. Some leave me truly confused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but no doubt it will be after the rest of us have moved on to telepathic communications ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting stats: 6.8 million single women not reg to vote. 13.3 million women who are don't. Want change? Start here. WarOnWomen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could, but since I didn't change them to receive these, I shouldn't have to change them "back".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sangria is made and in the fridge. Bring on Friday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI, she's already been found.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Twitter,quit sending email to tell me what's happening on Twitter.If I want to know what's happenning on Twitter, I will go to Twitter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! I met Alisha_Beth in rl after I met her on twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, tapped fire. That was something like 4 hours I think. AuburnWA fire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. They didn't go offensive 'til 100+ minutes in. They'll be doing overhaul all night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Central Pierce may be one of the responding alarms. I sort of missed the first 90 minutes or so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is/was 4 alarm. Have Tacoma units covering our City. No for EOC. Just a fire thing. They had Zone Coordinator to handle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yuck. Whole valley smells like nasty acrid plastic melty smoke. Makes the eyes burn. AuburnWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AuburnWA 4th Alarm fire going offensive, after nearly 2 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn you Viacom and DirecTV. Your little spat cost me the chance to see Leela's mom date Zapp Brannigan on Futurama. GRRRRRRR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like a big storage complex is on fire in AuburnWA. Not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teaching CERT Train-the-Trainer today thru Thursday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>15 thumbs up for Tec-Nu. I remember when it was invented and it was immediately in all SAR packs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sms to 911 is in trials somewhere. Will have to remember where I read it though! smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 911 via twitter is pretty scary. Text message to 911 is already here though. 911 can't poll for data. Needs push. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not exactly sure what an Egov Social Media Specialist is, but King County is hiring and smem folks should look!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love PNW thunderstorms! Except for that one time my house got hit. Vinyl siding melts! expensive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More is required than official source info. Brain goes through many steps to confirm.Multi-channels important! smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's horrible! I've seen a few near misses. Makes me super careful with the saw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definately listen to your wife. The Gorge is the best! We go all days, every year. Nothing compares!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bizarre. When I look up your profile, it says 61, but when I view your graph, is says 10. Who did you piss off???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, htc phone fixed for now. Needed a ROM update to make sound again. Crazy piece of #&%^*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not intend to spend this beautiful day trying to get my phone to make sound again. htc fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no idea. I really like the slideout keyboard. I'm too slow at tapping the screen. I don't really want to switch carriers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I just don't know what they want, as they don't communicate with locals as near as I can tell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would require a switch to something other than T-Mobile. And breaking my contract. It's almost worth it at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm about to fling my htc phone through the nearest airlock. Ugh, what a piece of *&#.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For me, it doesn't matter. VOAD is somewhere over my head, but my COAD can get me data I need!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're working to put a solution in the hands of our local COAD that ties directly to our public works system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No power still = response phase for those without. Recovery can't start for them until the fridge works!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't have to be though. If infrastructure is up, should be collected electronically or combo with pen and paper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What competitive grant funds would these be? We've seen the disappearence of everything except EMPG, which isn't competitive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, but info we get in the short-term gives a better chance of getting it right in the long-term. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sad that I was off by an hour in joining smemchat. Not sad that I slept in though. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, that's one of my big uses for my ham team. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, sunshine, payday, vacation. It doesn't get much better than today ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure. I don't recall it mentioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PNNL is testing a similar app. I have it on my Android phone. Haven't played with it much tho. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Charlie, including ways to access without calling. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had mystery doorbell for a while. Neighbor caught kids who heard our house was haunted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could ask my mom if I wanted to be sure, but I don't want to hear about the damned things at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Craft people have to start now so they'll have stuff to sell at the holiday bazaars in September!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing is, there are great commercial products that prevent overload. It takes an investment, but they're out there. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope I don't end up regretting all those follow backs I just clicked on. overload<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like that topic a lot. If nobody has volunteered, I will raise my hand to lead smemchat this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody is launching those damned candle lanterns. Thought one wasn't going to clear neighbor's tree. MoronsWithExplosives and lanterns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there go the neighbors. MoronsWithExplosives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah the sweet smell of sulfur in the neighborhood. *wheeze* MoronsWithExplosives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even in the basement, the booms are loud. And the kitties are converging upon the humans. MoronsWithExplosives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a big BOOM. MoronsWithFireworks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Years ago: Adult Me: [with sparkler]. Dad [deadpan}: Hey, did you know you're on fire? Me: $%! *smack* *smack* MoronsWithExplosives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in my dispatching days, July 4th was the worst day of the year to work unless it was raining, thanks to MoronsWithExplosives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the record, I love, Love LOVE fireworks. I just greatly dislike MoronsWithExplosives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brought all my furry friends in the house in anticipation of MoronsWithExplosives. Stole that hashtag from garytx too, cuz it's awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. Maybe because they've not in the official warning path they don't implement plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been there in thunderstorms before. Got all the rides to ourselves! I know they do close down in severe conditions though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which disney? I know that Florida and California both have plans and have used them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would imagine this could put a damper on smem via twitter. I don't like the native apps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Needs a new battery driver for the G2. Mine thinks the battery is dead and shuts down. Put on charger, says 90%. fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kudos to DellHomeUS Social Media Outreach Team for fixing a problem with our order before it got to an unfixable point. customerservice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool job with an smem component.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Independent Consultant seeking to make the world a better place"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, enough of the BOOMs outside. fireworks annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, IT is just as bad! SMEMchat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point. It's a cascade effect too, with cuts at every level, there's less cavalry to come in to backup the locals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah. Arguably, even at full strength, this firestorm is beyond the capabilities of most any department. It's just too damned big.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever did you do to attrack the troll??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched live feed of strike team rolling down empty Colorado Springs streets. Tiny engines, humongous fire in the background.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got a live feed from Colorado streaming from computer to TV, plus other computer screens. I don't bother with TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have Colorado Springs news on no less than 3 screens surrounding me. There's definately a lot of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe start with the women?? smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll bet. No time for redcross to plan and ramp up. Lessons learned will be huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The photos coming out of WaldoCanyonFire are heartbreaking. One of those things that makes me want a red card, go bag, and plane tix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would assume that was a pre-made campaign. It would be a good one if the world weren't on fire right now. rei<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are commercial products that can nicely manage high volume sites.Takes pre-plan though. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is truth. In Seattle area, we anticipate big interface fires within 15 years due to climate change and development.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that and I prefernce for no roof fires. When I was dispatching, July 4 was worst day of the year! Much nicer with rain. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used something like that on FB for a while, but mostly it made me sad . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worried about friends in Boulder. They are all EM types so I know they are heeding warnings, but worried none the less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, no,no. Summer never starts til July 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me guess? Using Tweetdeck? I hate the fake fail message . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'll have to click the link and read them. Far to long for a tweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Commence long day. I left my glasses at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad. So preventable. My sister watched this all day from her work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the "exicitng-smem-folks" list name! smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate makes me sad. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Debby has the strangest forecast track I've ever seen for a hurricane. Looks like predicting a PNW storm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smem, looking for text based alerting for Brandon, FL. Found county info, but no City website. Hard to believe City that size = no website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's called EchoLink. Can give you the URL off the top of my head though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A bunch of my hams are on social media too. I even have the ham app for my iPad and my Android.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh good grief. DellHomeUS fail. Order issue. Says 48 hours to contact. One hour later, they say 24 hours. They are closed 'til Monday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh tweetdeck, why do you refused to post my photos??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool Bird from SeattleTbirds came by our booth yesterday to learn about disaster preparedness. Thanks Cool Bird!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear DellHomeUS, when I purchase online from you, don't split into three seperate charges. Freaks credit card company out & they block you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear weatherchannel: Mt. Rainier is in Washington, not Oregon. Google it or something next time ... fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even the old girls?? :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I discover that two of my friends (you) know each other. Small, small world ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. I never saw that option page. I'll have to look again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did try tweetbot, but it didn't seem to have an automatic URL shortener.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have never had an iPad app crash until today. Thanks TweetCaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's exactly what I needed to make my day better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just said that chum salmon is the same as chinook salmon! Let's go fishing & I'll show you the difference!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Find someplace domestic where you can connect via Allegiant Air. Farily cheap to/from Vegas domestically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I'm going to Defcon too. Maybe we can finally meet IRL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I added dm_girl as one of my influencers on klout. Who influences you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's awesome! (the flash mob).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disaster friends, it's probably worth the $30 investment just for the poster! Kickstarter - Disaster Looms!:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I would agree with that, on EM as profession is still developing more than changing. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emergency response hasn't really changed. Fire still needs real water! The support mechanisms have though. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're supposed to sign up either as a reporter or as a source. It's pretty simple.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's nothing like waking up with a migraine. And on Friday no less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying out TweetCaster based on your recommendation. Like it so far. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With laser beam eyes no less!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Won't be there, but might if they called it an nhl arena! SonicsArena<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lesson of the day: Always be aware of how the words that come out of your mouth will affect the people around you (for better or worse).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gripe of the day: incident tweets with vague locations. First tweets I saw of the Auburn shootings had me worried for my own town. smem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go like ShelterBox's Facebook page and help them earn a $5000 donation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wondered if you were playing in that. Is it going well?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Almost 4 months until the next hockey game. Good thing it's summer so there are other things to do ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody in smem have a twitter client for iPad to reccomend? I find the actual Twitter client highly annoying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And I share of my sis's goaties tonight. goattweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to bed so I can get up the crack of dawn to facilitate a CERT final drill. In the rain. *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And possibly the M key too ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see to be losing the D key on my laptop. This is not good since it feels fine. I don't know it missed until I go back and read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just read a blog written in Comic Sans. My eyes hurt now. ComicSansMustDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo, smem peeps. King County Transportation is hiring a PIO. Specially asks for sm sample.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried to share yesterday with kateesackhoff but tiny keyboard made me miss! trutriciahelfer corrected me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're govt. We have policies for everything! SM is covered in the same one that makes me swear not to download porn. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A7: and don't forget that sm is more than just Twitter. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A7: have your legal ducks in a row. Know what your requirements are and how you're going to meet them. Was big challenge for us. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A7: dive in on your own an learn something about it before trying to sell the concept to agency. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. What I meant was that they have to know we're using it or no connection is made. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A6: we use SM nearly every day. have to get public used to it so they know to look during incident. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A5: potentially increases access to govt = good. Ex: tweeted about roads and got reply from wsdot with specific info for me. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A5: I don't really think so. It's a good buzzword, but use of SM does not mean you are transparent. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A4: have seen great use of Twitter locally to feed the media beast. funny to see "pio reports via Twitter" in breaking news story! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My bad! I follow both. Tiny keyboard selected the wrong one!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A4: provides a very convenient avenue of info dissemination to a growing segement of the population smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A3: we battled with our IS people. They thought since it was digital, they should own it and restrict it. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Essentially, we just started doing it. Buy-in came as citizens responed positively. Now electeds expect use of sm. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, absolutely. If Public Affairs didn't embrace, it wouldn't happen. I got them well trained! smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, they are, but many were doing things before a policy existed. Had to figure out who was doing what already. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downside is that some of our SM predates our policies so we've had to do some catchup. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the most important component is being organized about it and clear on who does what. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2.2 our Public Affairs has really embraced SM an we work very closely with them. We've built together. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2: our plans are a little bit hodge podge as we've been building them. All of the above are in them tho. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yes, ours too is part of our city-wide public affairs/communication/public information strategy. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our City has a plan and we fall under that. It's very non-restrictive. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not an excuse at all, but a different learning style and outlook. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's why we're running a high school CERT program now. Funny thing is that ICS is really easy for them too. smemchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be too hard on folks. Remember that generationally, many of us don't remember a time without computers. smemchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Class issue with pets in disasters: people w/resources for hotel could take pets. Those in shelters couldn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After Katrina, 15000 pets were rescued but only 3000 were reunited with owners. All rescued from flood water were positive for heartworm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Interrupting your totally non-serious convo, but what does vost stand for? Know what it does, but can't make the acronym work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. And it's hard enough just to do that these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interestingly, they seem to have very strong support in the school zones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ones in enforced intersections have some additional info on them, but in small type.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of ours say "photo enforced" but some similar language. Funny, I pass them every day and can't remember what they say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The big argument in our city has been about warning signs placed in intersections that don't have the cameras.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sort of ambivalent about the cameras. If we were making money, I might feel differently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anecdotally, it seesm that rear-end accidents are less deadly than t-bones. Can't back that up though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I remember more current info that said t-bones were down but rear-end collisions were up. Can't find the reference tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In many places, yes. If you look at the stats on ours though, nobody is making money off them. They're actually costing us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will see if I can find the news article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The PD compiled the stats. Full disclosure, they are also my employer! Note that only t-bone accidents decreased. Not other kinds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do operate cameras in our City. And in spite of the bad press, our t-bone accident rate has dropped significantly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Quote of the day: Cinco de Mayo isn't that big a deal in Mexico. Mostly it's an American beer makers holiday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. Mines buzzes, hard to ignore!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though for the record, I don't think we fundamentally disagree. Just diff approaches to same core issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I enjoy debating with you! Always logical and factual, which I appreciate. Makes it much more pleasant to disagree peacefully!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's precisely why my pub ed is now focused on low income and other vulnerable. They benefit the most, have greatest need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point! Still not a quick or easy solution. Takes long-term commitment and change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saying there has to be a common sense approach that allows greatest good for greatest number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Creates confusion though. We say "no pop-up shelters" and then we say "unless you're non-compliant, then go ahead, but no support"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great for getting in, but narrow halls and small bathrooms can't be quickly fixed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's exactly my point! Plans need to reflect reality of what will really happen and acknowledge what we're working toward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not here! My only concern really is for the big one since I know resources will quickly be tapped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can't support unofficial shelters, so non-accessible community buildings are on their own. Counterintuitive to helping people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The issue is that I can't house enough people in the buildings we own. If we can't rely on community, people go unsheltered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus I need to work and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Silly to tell a non-accessible church that they're not allowed to provide refuge and must leave people out in the cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Example: all city buildings are accessible. Shelters potentially in non-city buildings though. We have no control over them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We do build that way now (solution in progress) but much old building stock still in use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) other people are willing to step up and help those who need it. I don't think it's unsolved. I think the solutions are in play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two reasons. 1) People live longer with disabilities now. Didn't used to be the large-scale issue that it is now. And . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live by "do the most good for the most people" and if I have to use a building that isn't compliant, I will make it work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just don't understand the "if we can't help everyone, we're not allowed to help anyone" mentality. Morally, it's reprehensible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed! I think the public is smarter than government though and will find ways to make it work without our meddling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that. I understand need to be ADA compliant, but to ban all from an otherwise viable shelter is silly and can cause harm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hurricanes in Florida and tornadoes in Kansas don't get much "play" in my city, but earthquakes anywhere do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely some truth there, but large events similar to what we can experience get attention too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed! It just raised a few eyebrows among the uninformed. Required some internal education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take advantage of your message reaching a much broader audience! smem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sad. Dr. Dan thought he had 90 minutes, not 45. Only got to do half his presentation. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Dan: you don't do this job by yourself. You need a buddy or 10. piepc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dr. Dan: if you lose everything will you be the victim, the exploiter, the bystander or the thriver? piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Dan: thrivers are empowered givers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Dan: bystanders are powerless givers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I don't hear him saying right or wrong, good or bad. Just categorize people's responses based on behaviors. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I don't hear him saying right or wrong, good or bad. Just examples of individual reactions and catagorizing them. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Dan: exploiters are empowered takers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Dan: victims are powerless takers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Dan: two types of people in the world. Givers and takers. Takers will suck the life out of you. piepc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dr. Dan: some people do not become victims even in the case of big disaster. What makes them tick? piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Dan Diamond: what one word would you use to say how you feel if an earthquake took all your stuff? Was it collaborate? piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a doctor in the house? Yes! Dr. Dan Diamond, sharing stories from the disaster trenches. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to kick off piepc Day 2 with Dr. Dan Diamond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now it's time to network and socialize! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mass fatality plan should incorporate procedure for catastrophic event where Coroner or Medical Examiner are not able to respond. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always consider that a mass fatality may be result of criminal act, which changes procedures. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full DMORT team costs $1 Million per day for full deployment. Not a local resource for most jurisdictions. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expect to find bodies in strange places after widespread events like pandemic flu. Dumpsters, curbs, outside hospitals. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dead bodies are not inherently dangerous. Leave them be unless critical to move. If moved, must document thoroughly. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Local jurisdictions have huge support role in mass fatality incident. Must be prepared to support adequately. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Single person (or outlet) shoots video and releases to all outlets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ensure local EM plan (CEMP in WA) includes section on mass fatalities and process to support process. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh. Freaky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You did understand right. Media pool is great use of resources. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make distinction between reported dead and confirmed dead. Only Medical Examiner or Coroner can confirm deaths. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JIC is huge component of mass fatality incidents. Must have one. Watch media reports for info you don't know. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kitten card??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Consider psych impact of temp morgue site: if school gym, kids may refuse to go back. Consider parking garage. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't cremate or bury a body without a permit. It's attached to the death certificate. Who knew?? piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Data from family members can lead to conflicting data. Mom says no tatoo, sis says has tattoo. Makes task of body ID harder. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mass fatality incident will always require some kind of family assistance center and call-in capability. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mass fatality: closed population - we know who is supposed to be dead. Open population: we have no idea. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mass fatality is any fatality incident that overwhelms ability to deal. Likely to be smaller number for smaller counties. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Santa Clara County has a great mass fatality plan to use as a guide. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three different systems in WA: Prosecuting Attorney/Coroner, Coroner, Medical Examiner. WA is only state that has the first one. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three different systems in WA: Prosecuting Attorney/Coroner, Coroner, Medical Examiner. WA is only state that s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody has a role to play in mass fatality planning and response. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mass fatality planning: we're talking about dead people, just to be clear! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowe: go back to your communities and ask uncomfortable questions. Don't accept "we're ready". Prove it. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowe: God sends angels in the form of trained responders to help those in need. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowe: surprise, speed and violence of attack are what active shooters use. LE must use same. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowe: infantry tactics are what works in active shooter events. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowe: showed video of courthouse shooting where LE response was 6 minutes after shooting left. All on in-house cameras. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowe: active shooter event will put your city of the map for hours or days. Be ready! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowe: statistically, shooter kills themselves at first contact or sign of police. Quick contact by LE saves lives. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowe: statistics show active shooters are not stopped by SWAT. They are stopped by the first person able to take the shooter out. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowe: give media what they need in order to keep them out of harms way. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recordings of 911 calls always bring back old memories. This call was from Columbine. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched a video of a guy pulling a concealed rifle out of his pants. Thought provoking! Where will an active shooter hide guns? piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bill Lowe from JSU talking about active shooter events. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current research on CISD points to need to change it in order to not cause more harm piepc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oops! Nadolski. Sorry for the typo. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nadlowski: disasters are on the increase. Bigger populations in impact areas. Migration to coasts is increasing risk. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting in the back now, can't read the slides. Need better eyes I think! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Bray: brain in crisis perceives time different. Things seem to take longer. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Bray: mind under stress records info differently. Can't remember more than 2 things. Keep notes of 3 or more tasks. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Bray: asparagus is strong diuretic. Carry in your kit, store in your EOC. Canned of course! Flushes salt, avoid cramps. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Bray: stress causes salt buildup in cartilage. Causes muscle spasms. Ow! Avoid salt. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Bray: bathrooms need triple amount of supplies during response. See previous tweet on tummy troubles! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Bray: eat a small meal every 2 hours during response to ward off tummy troubles. piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Bray: don't forget the breath mints for the EOC. Byproduct of stress is "moose breath"! piepc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Bray: Want to kill a stress headache? Hide in a dark closet for 20 minutes. piepc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Gen Y guy: current work force is 4-5 years older than many of us were at our first jobs. iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charvet: the prettier your presentation is, the more likely it is you're trying to hide something. No Powerpoints! iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charvet: balanced score card works for EM. iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note to self: you cannot see the screen from the back of the room anymore without your glasses. iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charvet: use metrics to explain why you can't keep doing more with less. iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charvet: need to be able to explain our results to the people who fund our work. iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charvet: hearing about mistakes of others should help us not to repeat. iaem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Coincidentally, now at a session "do we really learn from disasters". Let's hope so! iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Problem is that we observe the same lessons repeatedly but never actually learn them and fix them. iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lessons learned from Chilean earthquake: communication, command, planning. Nothing new here! iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Graham: make every day a training day. iaem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I will get to go to IAEM because I got grant funds for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I have no out of state travel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for any who might wonder, caroldn is one of my best buds, even if we don't agree about the DOJ!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of biggest gaps we found was lack of access to cheap portable radio. that is now our pub ed giveaway for the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make that "or" money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are using concept of "what do you already have" for preparedness education. New mindset, more empowering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line is plenty of people to tell EM what we must do. Few willing to invest time our money into helping though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public transport critical since many with different abilities rely on it and all will need transport to DRC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But how to fix? No budgets and can't require partners to fix theirs. Feds face created no-win situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine PR nightmare: "City refuses to open public facility as shelter, fearing DOJ lawsuit". Why punish all when some can benefit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why should I have to exclude people from usable buildings when some CAN use them? Why not let them serve the people they can?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it is, but DOJ doesn't recognize regional efforts and will pass judgement upon locals for what they're doing locally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's all well and good, but I don't have any more buildings! City has no more, schools have no generators. So 100 is our limit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that being the case, I can only shelter .0014% of my population. All other buildings must remain empty. DOJ's call, not mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missing the point again! DOJ doesn't recognize that difference. All shelters must provide all services according to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. All others could stay there, but because some can't, I'm in violation, even though I have other places for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe you should give up flying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DOJ doesn't care about critical diffs, only diffs. Mine is missing showers, transit routes, generator switch, med care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All meet their requirements for day to day use, but none were built to be emergency shelters. Emergency use is the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missing the point! All my buildings are ADA compliant, but they cannot provide the same services to all as emergency shelters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure, but that's not what DOJ cares about. They want every person to have equal access at every shelter site. Not possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not saying I can't or won't help, just that DOJ is likely to sue us for planning for it since we can't provide equality for all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't get me wrong, I can provide great service to those extra .002%, just not in a way that will satisfy the DOJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By acknowledging that additional .002% though, makes me subject to DOJ sanctions. No fix for me, as no addl facilities or $$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perspective: 5 years ago, I could shelter 0% of my population. Now, in a DOJ compliant way, .0014%. Non-compliant: .0035%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see that we've made huge strides, both in thinking and capacity/capability. All that could be squished in an instant by DOJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There hasn't been an EM community for all that many decades! I guess sitting on mass care task force, I have diff outlook than you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I meant Congress staffers heard, not DOJ. Agree that they ought to go out and try doing the dirty one once or twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the recent Big Cities meeting, DOJ rep got a pounding, with congressional aids in attendance. Message was heard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But you're not the wonk headed DOJ attorneys who are interpreting the guidelines! They do not see things reasonably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at the link to Project Civic Access I sent you earlier Carol. It has guidance and settlements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EM job at WA EMD:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We took my nephew to the Solstice Parade one year. He refused to tell his mom what he saw at the parade. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of our city facilities are ADA compliant, but not all meet DOJ standard for sheltering/FNSS/etc.Nothing I can do to fix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Point is DOJ is not allowing for time needed to change/adapt. Money being directed into lawsuits instead of into needed changes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should. But most govts don't physically own enough facilities to shelter 10% of their own population. Have to use what is avail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now only reasonable solution is to not designate shelters, only pick at time of need. No time for DOJ to butt nose in and sue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, prioritize is great. DOJ requires that all be equal. No room for prioritization. Thus, Philly saying they're not doing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DOJ sued Philly because not ALL facilities were EQUALLY accessible. Same thing happening in Seattle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I made a donation to Lifelong AIDS Alliance a few weeks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DOJ attitude is that all shelters must be equally accessible to all people. No latitude. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not foot stomping. It's best use of limited resources. No predesignated shelters = no lawsuit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Philly example: Had plan to shelter big numbers, but not all were ADA compliant, so got sued by DOJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we are going to be punished for trying, then why try?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is that by having them, cities risk huge lawsuits from the feds so they are starting to stop having them at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Diff perspective on shelters: If the DOJ is going to sue cities for trying their best, why bother since there is no legal mandate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we were on our honeymoon to boot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least they didn't put you all on the plane and then decide they had no pilot. Had that happen once ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tsunami Advisory for Alaska. Tsunami Watch for Oregon/Washington/Cali/BC coasts. Somebody forgot to press send with the first notice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you sure of that info regarding the watch? I've been unable to confirm via a solid source.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of Pacific basin under warning now:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF, note IF, it were to make it to west coast, see approx arrival times:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tsunami watch for continental west coast US now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Piles of burning rubble washing along the top of the tsunami wave. Cars fleeing. Crashing. Unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now upgraded to 8.9. Aftershocks exceeding 7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Live feeds on CNN are pretty impressive. Large buildings floating away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive quake in Japan. Tsunami watches and warnings across Pacific basic (excluding continental North America). Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're going to sing the national anthem, you really need to get the words right ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wichita is ... Flat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The big earthquake off Japan this morning has generated a confirmed tsunami. Only a small one measured in Saipan and no threat here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back home in soggy Seattle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently Planet Hollywood sucks at crowd management. The show was supposed to start almost 15 minutes ago and the line into the theate ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teaching CERT this morning. My voice came back a little bit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh how time drags on some days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ellensburg. Something resembling Slurpee falling from the sky. Truck stop chicken strips for dinner. And a hot cup of tea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>35 degrees and rain in Yakima. Auburn here I come! No doubt I will make worse time going west than I did coming east!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Auburn to Yakima in 2 hours. Booyah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to Yakima to speak at SERVES. Can't find my iPod FM transmitter though, so no good tunes. Bah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got regular seats for Dave and Tim at McCaw Hall for night one, and VIP for night two. Big donations coming out of this charity event!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I reached 100 followers today! Not sure why, but I do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They found us a plane and now they're waiting on the crew from the original plane to hike down here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well crap. Plane is out of service and now they are looking for a new one for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boarding has been halted due to a maintainence issue on our plane. Interesting. In a bad way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A whole group of nuns and a priest went through airport security in front of me. Wonder if they're on my flight??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're starting a high school CERT, which will be for credit. Might be a good intro to the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mike Martinet pinch hitting for an extremely ill Janine Driver. Improv is what we do! iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only one day of IAEM conference to go. One more day to learn new things and meet new people. iaem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Craig Fugate's speech at IAEM gives me hope that FEMA is going to become a great federal asset again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Msducttape presentation at IAEM rocked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's warm and sunny here at DFW. I think I might have sunburned my neck on the plane though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seatac is calm and peaceful this morning, with a slight fog mist on the ground in places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CERT drill done. A few trainees hanging around giving interviews to the Auburn Reporter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sort of figures that as soon as we make plans for Vegas, Dave Matthews announces Seattle shows!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At Soroptimist northwest region District 1 meeting in Marysville for the weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SoundShake day 2 going well on our end. Only 5 hours to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SoundShake 2010 exercise in full swing! My EOC is humming along nicely without me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So muggy outside. Ick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>City of Auburn Disaster Preparedness fair today 11 to 4 at Les Gove Park. Come join us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are people crawling around in the ceiling over my desk. Disconcerting. Should fix the HVAC issue though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah for rain! Should make Saturday a good day for fishing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off we go to stalk the mighty salmon again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't find hip waders small enough for my feet at any store. Must go online I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who knew that library cards expired??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the road to DMB, Slurpees in hand!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a teeth rattling 62 degrees and falling in the office today. They are working on it though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>76 pounds of freshly caught Alaska fish has arrived at SeaTac for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does it have to be only 67 degrees in my office???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody breached the President's air space and the F18 scramble created a sonic boom. Wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taught CERT Intro this morning and teaching ICS 400 today and tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At SeaTac, found dad, now breakfast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only 5 more hours until vacation. I hope I can make it that long without hurting someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is way too cold in my office today. My hand keeps going numb!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot how cold the pacific ocean is in Oregon! Toe cramps!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lincoln City here we come!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent training and the added bonus of watching Seattle "wildlife"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited to go to a presentation by Elaine Enarson today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Visit from our sister city, Tamba, Japan today. So much bowing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dissertation committee approved. Booyah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dinner reservations made for somebody's 40th birthday tomorrow. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It looks awfully gloomy for supposedly reaching 75 today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Test message from my ping.fm account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NWS has issued a Flood Watch for Pierce County thru Wednesday evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping for a Seattle to Anchorage fare sale on AlaskaAir very, very soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regence sucks. After 10 days of bureaucratic bs, they deny my migraine meds, stating I have to try all the others first when I know this ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the Red Cross Heros Breakfast. Started with the Seahawks drum line. That wakes you up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Debunking the Triangle of Life myth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NBC sucks. I nope they don't get the Olympic coverage contract for future years. Seriously, the should be barred from Olympic coverage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An interesting note: medals in men's and women's hockey were the same: Gold - Canada, Silver - USA, Bronze - Finland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loved seeing the two games we did attend, but to have had tix for this one would have been the ultimate. Maybe for Sochi! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today we find out who the true hockey fans are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you NBC for COMPLETELY SUCKING! How dare you explain hockey using football terms. A forecheck IS NOT A BLITZ!! How I long for CBC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chocolate Cheerios, a cup of coffee, and Gold Medal USA vs Canada hockey game about to start. Woohoo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Latest West Coast info, including reference to Ventura County damage:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Latest recorded wave heights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oceanographer on CNN just stated that there was tsunami damage in Ventura County, Cali, but I can't find any other reports to verify.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Official "it's started" notice from PTWC:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tsunami has officially begun on the Big Island according to the PTWC. 3 foot rises observed thus far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fascinated that the news broadcasts are using feeds from Skype users rather than trying to get their own cameras to "the scene".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a live feed from Hawaii, showing some idiot out in the ocean bobbing around. He/she may have a short but interesting life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Southern Cali waves reported at about 2 feet high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, so far 57 total quakes on that plate that are 4.9 or greater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bewildered by some of the advice being thrown out on FB and Twitter. Follow instructions of local officials, not random Internet ppl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish there was a live webcam feed from Hilo that wasn't completely overloaded right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quote of the day on CNN, via some guy on a webcam in Chile with a Spanish accent: I almost peed my pants!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we had stayed in Hawaii, we'd be in the heart of the evac area. Freaky!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess is that servers aren't being overwhelmed by locals. Having just gotten back from Hawaii, it's pretty clear where to evac to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to sleep land now. Still sort of on island time, but need to be back on Seattle time by Monday morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to clarify, an advisory, a watch, and warning are different things. Good explanation at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like that 9 ft report wasn't really wrong: 42min Valparaiso C 33.0S 71.4W 0859UTC 2.60M/8.7 FT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a test from TweetDeck to see if it really posts all the places it claims to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying out TweetDeck here in a minute. Starting to see the value in such an app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I realized I should have been tweeting as I was gathering Chile quake news. Now at least I'll put up a few accurate links!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got home from 3 days of DMB to find my house was hit by lightning! lost a lot of stuff, but all can be replaced!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>_MovieTickets_ so now I'm following the Red Carpet Rewards Club because we've started going to movies again. IMAX rocks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Auburn has been asked to conserve water, but lawn watering has not been banned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the very hot drag strip tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattr Red Cross is hiring. hurry , closes may 15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I disagree on the discussion forums Bill. I really like them. There are cooler things, but availability is limited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Citibank sucks. Really, really sucks. Card with lower rate ended up raising my rate by 7%. Time to take business elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to upgrade to Comcast business class Internet. Regular customer service can't seem to help and business won't call Jon back. Idiots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big wind coming to Western Washington Monday night/Tuesday morning. 980 mb low on it's way ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah! Big change. Good luck in this job market!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know exactly nothing about Macs. And I don't know what version of PP will be on the computers. I don't suppose there's a save as<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the person with the Mac knows how and has a thumb drive, probably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dont' forget to vote for Spoleto's as best pizza:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great story on the dangers of solar storms:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad for loss of flex days. Glad for still having job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, and happy Bday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for helping me hate the new FB a little tiny bit less!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's just for you again, not for us lowly folks. Er, lowland folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has gone from not liking the new Facebook UI to outright hating it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is not liking the new FB home page. Too many things missing and no instructions on where to find them again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>24 clockhours available for teachers who take Auburn CERT class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear DirecTV: Your DVR is a piece of poop. I want my TiVo back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pondering this late season storm and thankful we still have pellets for the pellet stove!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So does HR Block have some sort of guarantee?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for the snow or something like it to fall in Auburn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a 20 MPH wind gust at the house. Blew the cat flap right open!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the bus headed for hockey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally finished the CEMP! Now on to updating the hazard mitigation plan . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had no idea this weekend was time change!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just sat thru a meeting to learn that none of my programs and projects qualify for stimulus money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just say thru a meeting to learn that none of my programs and projects qualify for stimulus money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats PDX on being the most unhappy City in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, we call that shadow a volcano!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot you live in the convergence zone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't scare me like that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see one for the foothills, but not down low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm seeing no active advisories. Where have you seen this vicious rumor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the hockey game being entertained by the dudes from Venezuela behind us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Large person just say ob my coat on bus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the bus watching a dude burn his finger with a lighter. on purpose .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for the bus to take me to the hockey game it's late!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is pleased that I found the Girl Scouts and their cookies at the store. 5 boxes pleased. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad that the recession has finally hit our City, in spite of all the cost cutting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting in a street improvement meeting. 3rd meeting of the day. 3 day weekend though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a regional planning meeting for the Green River<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering if Governor Jindal has any sort of clue at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are working on disaster recovery planning now. It has been eye opening for many!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting in a FEMA applicant agent briefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever type my brother seems to have come down with this morning! wondering when im out of the woods<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to remember what the incubation period for the flu is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wishing i was outside instead of doing an AAR Corrective Action Plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's awesome Eric. Congrats! A couple of my City volunteers work for the Port, so you'll have likeminded folks around. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If nobody tells you about it, then you can't miss it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy to see the sun today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is pleased with the new direction our Citizen Corps Council is taking. They will be lead for our soon to be formed COAD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mostly I was looking forward to socializing with fellow risk communicators!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bummed that my NAGC Risk Communications seminar was canceled. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would replace decide with influence. We can't decide the outcome. There are things that are out of our control!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or better yet, "Fortunately, the choices we make greatly influence the outcome of those disasters"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"fortunately".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking for a great Twitter app for Blackberry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweeting from the new BB!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting anxiously for my new (personal) Blackberry to arrive on Thursday. Yeah for the Pearl flip!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just hoping we get through the rest of this flood season with no big rain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Scout night at the T-birds. OMG they're everywhere!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering if I'm ever going to get my school papers and dissertation written.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to hockey now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think so. We left notices with just under 400 businesses and had probably just over 100 people in the room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad the first community meeting went well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping the forecast stays relatively dry ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopes more insurance agents will educate themselves on flood insurance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know that feeling. Working 6 day weeks with no end in sight right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must take the Christmas tree down ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We'll never really be ready for the big one. Even doing our best, I think all we can hope is readiness for the medium one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now, my entire world revolves around possible floods. That quake the other morning woke me up, as I thought "here we go!".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's awesome! Maybe they were warm-up shocks, not aftershocks. Happy thought for the day ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's two quakes in 3 days. Hmmmm .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like there was just a 3.6 quake out by Poulsbo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are they seriously doing that? Please say it isn't so?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait 'til it's on Hulu so I can share it with people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Office: a CPR class just turned into a "Staying Alive" sing-along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm howling over The Office. They're talking about emergency preparedness. Fake fire, throwing cats, heart attacks, the Red Cross "racket".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving my new Blackberry Curve, though the cat is not fond of the current ringer. He RAN when it rang this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited about getting my new Blackberry in the morning. Camera, file storage, small enough to hold with one hand ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're using Twittermail and just sending e-mails to it. Allows multiple users at work, which is really handy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting at the hockey game. woohoo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Google maps lets you make your own custom maps with pinpoints. Don't know about the photos though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. Insurance companies consider most water that hits the ground before coming in your house to be a flood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping folks remember to buy flood insurance, even if it's not raining!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am now officially sick of this winter:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working on quarterly taxes and stuff for the pizza biz. I just want a day to do nothing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus I'm sure the headsets didn't help. If you expend all your energy yelling at the phone, none left to worry with!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard a bit about it from some folks who were there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not looking forward to the mountain of paperwork that must be done in the next 2 weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited that my city is on twitter! coaupdates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering if the Ceder river is ever going to go down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hates it when the conference phone dies in the middle of the webinar. hurrah for Blackberries with speakerphones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a webinar on Web 2.0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love crunching data! I actually enjoying doing the PDAs and federal reimbursement filings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got em. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would love to see ones of Pacific if there are any. Never got to see any of it for myself in the daylight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I drove home like that once. I remember suddenly becoming aware of where I was and having no idea how I got there. Scary!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Late this afternoon I realized my volunteer PIO in training had been up for more than 24 hours. I let her go early!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back home. Lots of work got done in Pacific today, lots still to go. It's great to see a community pull together to support each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to bed for my early shift tomorrow. Normally wouldn't be so tired, but I came down with a cold just as this all started. Ugh ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's fascinating to see. We spent time on Thursday doing the calculations ourselves to see what they were going to push us to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dunno. Never actually used it. I'm barely literate with plain ol' twitter!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't that what tweetdeck does?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waflood That's by design. Once the river levels drop, they start dumping from the reservoirs. Record levels there this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only downside to all this tweeting is that many organizations simply don't have the capacity or expertise to carry it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conditions greatly improved in Pacific and recovery in full-swing. The Home Depot disaster team showed up and is going house to house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What topic are you being interviewed on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read the book Acts of God by Ted Steinberg. Humans have a great role to play in how disasters play out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were still doing rescues & had people screaming at us about fixes. You're right about demanding them fast!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On deck for Planning Section Chief for Pacific at 0700 Sunday. Today is nap and laundry day. And as always monitoring the Green River!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent the day as EOC Manager for Pacific. Long day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is back from delivering cots and blankets. There is a LOT of water in Pacific. 300 homes impacted, some with 4-6 feet of water in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working with a Sgt from Algona PD to arrange shelters for the evacd residents of Pacific. Might be sending them to Renton ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>City of Pacific just declared a state of emergency and has voluntary evacuations in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is officially a record amount of water:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was nice to call the KC ECC and end up talking to Mayor Pro Tem George Hadley from Normandy Park. A calm voice in a sea of chaos. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another long day. Waiting for the Green River to crest tonight to see if we have any flooding issues. Corps says they'll keep it at 12000cfs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw that I-5 is closed for an extended period. Given the lack of suitable alternatives, that does not bode well for our food supply<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm finally home after 14 hours. Suspect I'm going to get called out as soon as I go to sleep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very funny for the EMS types in the house:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of standing water on Auburn roadways. My street nearly under water already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That might mean I don't have to go to work in the morning! The entrance to my driveway is almost under water already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Intrigued by the idea of Governor Gregoire being named Secretary of Commerce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is looking for someone to manager a pizza parlor in Mt. Angel Oregon. Last manager flamed out after 2 months. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoyed the first hockey game at the Showare Center tonight, even though the concourse was poorly designed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I own a pizza place and can't even imagine doing this to my employees:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Updating the Spoleto's website. It will still be ugly, but it will be current!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My house was built in 1939. I should officially be worried now I guess. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Headed off to ShoWare arena shortly for open house. Yeah for hockey in South King County!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a somewhat old study. I'll see if I can find it. I know I have a hard copy around the house somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's old news!! My sister is trying to get here from Tri-Cities. Ended up turning around and coming down the Columbia Gorge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any word on Crystal or the roads to Crystal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's so true! My new educators always have their pitch down pat. They have a really hard time adapting to their audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering how I'm going to get everything done this week in just 3 days of work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the lvely snow fall in Kansas City and anticipating going home tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>70+ MPH winds here in Kansas City last night. Only minor power outage here, but moderate damage in other nearby places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In KC, Mo.. 30 degree high yesterday, 68 today, t-storms and tornado watch tonight. High Saturday 37. Freaky weather here!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at 40 minute delay in flight departure. Afraid of going to SeaTac with confirmed tickets on confirm flight. May get mugged!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh. Well, that makes sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Seattle is like most cities around, we're all broke! We may or may not get a federal declaration out of this, which would help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the City spent millions on snow plows that sat idle more of the year, or multiple years, people would be mad about that too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, but somebody still has to pay them. Either the City or the neighborhood. Snoqualmie City paid for private contractors to plow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gee, I feel so bad for him! He's following the first rule of EM though: BOOT -- Be Out Of Town!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, in nearly every CERT class we do, somebody asks about guns!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. About 1457 miles east of this KC ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to head for KC tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrapping up some work and hoping they have enough de-icer for our plane tomorrow!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sis in Portland works for a distributor that supplies quicky marts. The roads to their facilities are closed. No food going out to markets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just went outside. Holy cow!! 6" of new, probably 2" of old, still coming down hard. We'll have a foot on the ground by morning at this rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, not Eric! That would indeed be embarrassing. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parts of Oregon in bad shape.Dad 15 miles E of Salem, no power, thick ice from freezing rain, phones sporadic, tree fell while talking to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found a speaker cancellation hidden in a thread in my inbox. Bah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. I would wear my fingers out if I responded to every blog post that got me fired up. And I'd be talking to myself mostly. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just be glad you're actual job is not to convince wacko bloggers of anything. I usually resist the urge to comment on blog posts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny thing is that I'm comfortable with it too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alaska Airlines and Horizon have suspended service at this point. It's got to suck to work at the Port tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Newly issued winter storm WARNING. Guess what?? More snow tonight!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If people were listening to us (check on your neghbors, plan together), we would have stronger communities, not weaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I tell you my friend Anne with the State Department has her next post in Vladivostok?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On King County EM Conference call now. Ted from NWS is here to explain the failure of wind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is looking at 4" of new snow with a 1/4" crust of ice on top. Funny to watch the neighbor cat trying to navigate it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhhh. That would suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I confirmed it three different ways before sending it to my city staff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thankfully the NWS canceled the high wind warning. Of course that means more snow. No wind = no power outages = no need for shelters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't found anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friend of a friend reports high wind and power outages in Everett. No way to confirm, as Sno County PUD doesn't have an outage map online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out this afternoon's NWS weather briefing at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just checked outside and found much snow!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, be sure to remind people that shelters will only be setup if they're needed in King County and to stay tuned to their radios<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found my ham radio. *whew*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snow here, temperature dropping, a little bit of wind. And for some reason, I can't find my ham radio anywhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Work, home, is there a difference? I'm actually working from home unless things get worse and we stand up our ECC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or do people actually seem better prepared this year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No significant difference. We're either going to get more wind and less snow here in Auburn, or vice versa!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The snow has started and there's a little wind now. No significant change in the NWS forecast for here.<|endoftext|>
